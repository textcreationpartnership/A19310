            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He differences and diſagreements are ſuch, which in theſe fewe yeares laſt paſt haue bred, and daily grow to more and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in that kind, to ſo great a diſguſt of all ſincere Catholickes, not onely here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land but alſo in the principall, if not in all the parts of Chriſtendome, whither the worthie fame of their memorable acts for the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their natiue Country vnto the Catholicke faith hath come, that it is high time to giue them ſome taſte of theſe matters, who are ſo diſguſted, by laying before them the true cauſe, and grounds of this lamentable diſſention, and to diſcouer how colourably the common enemie of God, and his Church, hath proceeded to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance firſt of Gods Prieſts, then to the mutual diſlike of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes among themſelues, and of ſuch Priests as againſt whom by wrong informations they are violently led, and let not to vſe both tongue and penne in moſt vngratefull manner.</p>
            <p>Some, being asked by others what might be the cauſe of ſo great a ſtrife among the Prieſtes, haue ſimply anſwered that the cauſe is, for that the Prieſts being but ſecular men will not humble themſelues, or be directed or gouerned by the Ieſuites, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; but what truth ſoeuer is in this cauſe, of all other it muſt not be giuen, for ſuch a ſubiection, euen in the eares of thoſe who deſire it, ſoundeth ſo abſurdly, that they endeuour rather to haue it, then to heare of it, and both M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> in his Letters to the Cardi. <hi>Caietan</hi> dated the 10. of Ianuary 1596. and F. <hi>Parſons</hi> in his Letters againſt M. Doctor <hi>Biſh:</hi> and M. <hi>Ch:</hi> dated the 9. of October 1599. labour to put this conceit out of mens minds, how euidently ſoeuer the practiſe in <hi>Wisbitch</hi> to make Fa. <hi>Weſton</hi> the Ieſuite ſuperiour ouer the ſecular Priests (who then were in
<pb facs="tcp:9135:3"/> durance for the Catholicke faith: purſued both by the knowne, and couert Ieſuites, and all other their fauourites doth proue it, as alſo a Libell giuen abroad by the Authour thereof himſelfe, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh others to beware of ſuch Prieſts (and by no meanes to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dealing with them in ſpirituall matters, euen to the diſturbing of them out of their places of reſidence) as vnfit guides for ſoules, who had not a dependance of the Ieſuites. And not long ſince another of their fauourites letted not to ſay, that thoſe Prieſts who are not vnder the Ieſuites gouernment are no better then the Miniſters; Many more proofes may be made hereof out of the ſpeeches of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other their fauourites, who giue counſell to all that are afflicted in theſe turmoyles to ſubmit themſelues to the Ieſuites.</p>
            <p>Other ſome, (who perceiue well, that, if this ſhould be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be the true cauſe of ſo ſcandalous a ſchiſme in Gods church, it would redound to the eternall diſgrace, &amp; infamie of ſuch, as, by whom they hauing conceiued ſome fooliſh hope of preferment, they had rather that they ſhould indeed beare the ſway, &amp; haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Cleargie (although it were vnderhand) then be ſaid either to ſeeke it, or to haue it) giue out that the cauſe of this diuiſion among the Prieſts is, for that ſome Priests mooued either with ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or deſire of contradiction, will not ſubiect themſelues vnto their lawfull ſuperiour appointed by his holineſſe, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in authoritie ouer them by his Breue ſent into England for that purpoſe: and theſe haue from time to time both written, and maintained in moſt iniurious manner (to poſſeſſe the more perfectly ſuch as are too readie to thinke no calumniation too greeuous euen againſt thoſe who haue beſt deſerued of them) that theſe Priests are ſchiſmatickes, ſeditious, rebellious, &amp;c. euen to the diuiding for this cauſe of parents and their children, men and their wiues, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters, and whole houſholds, while the one retaining that reuerend respect of their long knowne, and tried ghostly fathers, for learning, wiſedome, and vertue, is aſſailed by the other with theſe most wicked ſuggestions, and falſe calumniations, and forced either to liue a diſcontented life, or to break friendſhip; and (againſt their owne conſciences) make ſemblance at the leaſt that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hardly of ſuch as they very well perſwade themſelues wil not
<pb facs="tcp:9135:3"/> commit ſo great offence againſt God, and his Church, in whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence they haue ſpent many yeares, and remaine ſtill reſolute to ſhead their deareſt bloud.</p>
            <p>That therefore no errour be hereafter in any man, who will not too much affect ignorance in ſuch things as concerne not onely his particular good but the Common cauſe of God, &amp; his Church (which whiles the Cleargie liueth at ſome variance in an euill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Countrey, cannot doubtleſſe but be very greatly preiudiced therby) it is thought expedient, yea neceſſarie, that the cauſe of this diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be with truth, and ſinceritie declared, &amp; made knowne to the world, that our actions and the reaſons thereof being weighed with equall ballances, truth may take place, the offerers of the wrong may be diſcouered, the vniuſtly afflicted may be relieued, and that eaſe (at the leaſt by theſe meanes) may be procured, which would not come of ſo long ſufferance.</p>
            <p>The ſtrife, and diſſention at this day too great, and ſcandalous in England, is maintained by the Arch-prieſt, the Ieſuites, &amp; their adherents, againſt thoſe Prieſts who did forbeare to ſubiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the Arch-prieſt conſtituted in authoritie ouer all the Seminary Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> by a Cardinall, who was Protector of the Engliſh Colledge at <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards honoured with the title of Protector of <hi>England,</hi> for the which forbearing to ſubiect themſelues at the firſt making knowne of this authoritie, the Prieſts were accuſed of ſchiſme, ſedition, faction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, &amp;c. All which calumniations were forgiuen by the Prieſts ſo grieuouſly iniuried, and a peace made to the great comfort of all Catholiques, when his holineſſe Breue was preſented vnto them, but this peace was ſoone after broken by the meanes of the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, who reuiued the ſame calumniations againſt the Prieſts, and by the Arch-prieſt, who did not onely auerre the aſſertions of the Ieſuites, but publiſhed alſo that he had receiued a reſolution from the mother Citie (to vſe his tearmes) which avowed that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers of the authoritie (noting by this phraſe the Prieſts who did forbeare for a time vpon cauſes ſeeming iuſt to them to accept thereof) were Schiſmatickes. So that the cauſe of this diuiſion now in England, is not for any reſistance in the Prieſts againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:9135:4"/> ſuperioritie, as many forward and euill taught people perſwade themſelues, &amp; cry out againſt the prieſts, that they are diſobedient. But the cauſe of this diuiſion is, for that the Prieſts will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that in the time of their forbearance to ſubſcribe to the authoritie (which was no longer then vntill they ſawe the Breue) they were factious, ſeditious, rebellious, Schiſmatickes, enormiouſly diſobedient, in continuall mortall ſinne, practiſing their function in irregularitie, and pretending to abſolue from ſinne without facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or iuriſdiction meete therevnto, worſe then South-ſayers and Idolaters, &amp;c. If therefore ſufficient reaſons may be giuen why the Prieſts did forbeare to ſubiect themſelues before they ſawe any Letters from his holineſſe concerning this authoritie, it will both appeare how greatly they haue bene iniuried both by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, Ieſuites, and their euill nurtured children, and how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie this courſe of publiſhing in this ſort, is for the purging of the other Prieſts from thoſe ſlaunderous ſpeeches; and here by the way do we aske of thoſe pious Catholiques, (for ſo they muſt be tearmed howſoeuer they deſerue it,) when they charge, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelues that they choake the Prieſts with diſobedience, what it is, that they meane by this diſobedience, if they meane ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that the Prieſts do not acknowledge M. <hi>Black.</hi> for their Arch-prieſt and ſuperiour, they may if it ſo pleaſe them correct this their vnderstanding, and from henceforth either beleeue that euery man dooth acknowledge him, or elſe name who doth not, and let him in particular be called in question for it: for this generall prattle that they are diſobedient is ſo vnſauourie a ſhift, vnleſſe they could diſcend to particulars, that a man with litle honestie would quickly perceiue how it doth taint his breath:</p>
            <p>If by diſobedience in the Prieſts they do meane the not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or conforming their vnderſtanding to the Arch-prieſt his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, they exact this obedience to the Arch-prieſt either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he is learned, or becauſe that he is a ſuperiour, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe respects conuince any ſuch matter, as that the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be ſo conformable ſhould bring with it ſchiſme, ſedition, fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rebellion, &amp;c. Not the firſt, which is in regard of his learning. For although that many in England for modestie ſake onely make
<pb facs="tcp:9135:4"/> no compariſons with him for his learning, yet without offence we may ſay that there are many beyond the ſeas farre his betters, and much more learned, who haue decided this queſtion for vs against him, ſo that the conceit only of being an Arch-prieſt, or in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is left for them to iustifie theſe most iniurions calumniations against vs. If then they exact this obedience in Priests to the Arch-prieſt, in reſpect that he is a ſuperiour, and becauſe that he is a ſuperiour they imagine that euerie man who will not thinke as he thinketh, and do what he commaundeth is a Schiſmaticke, a rebell, factious, ſeditious, &amp;c. Theſe who are ſo ignorant must be taught, and ſuch as are contented at this time to make ſhewe of ſo groſſe ignorance, muſt be put in mind that authoritie is not an infallible rule of truth in all who haue authoritie, and conſequently that no man is bound in all things to beleeue or execute what eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man in authoritie ouer him ſhall put vpon him. In how many things not onely Arch priests but their ſuperiours alſo the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, and other of higher degree haue done amiſſe, and ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the truth? and who vpon earth is warranted from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but one, and not he in all things? how abſurdly then ſhould this point be vrged that the Prieſts are Schiſmatickes, rebellious, &amp;c. for not conforming themſelues in their vnderſtanding to an Archpriest? And if the ſimpler ſort of Catholiques cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this reaſon ſufficiently grounded vpon too many examples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in all Eccleſiasticall Histories, we would demaund of them, when they are commaunded to doo that by ſuch as are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie vpon their alleageance, which in conſcience they cannot doo, whether they be rebellious, factious, ſeditious, &amp;c. in not obeying this commaundement? or by what reaſon they may in not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolue their conſciences, that they are not rebellious, &amp;c?</p>

            <head>Certaine Conſiderations, to ſatisfie ſuch as either are, or may be, by any ſinister informations or ill conceipts incenſed against vs, or alienated from vs, becauſe we haue not yeelded our ſelues to the deſignments &amp; wills of others, in ſubſcribing to this late authoritie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt we deſire all good Catholickes to conſider indifferently, what we be, that deferre our ſubſcription to this authoritie; that we be Prieſts, &amp; therfore in reaſon ſhould know, to what we were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in this caſe.

            <p>Further, that for many yeares we haue beſtowed our ſelues in this harueſt, and therefore in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſhould ſomewhat knowe what thinges were moſt conuenient for our ſelues and Country. Then that many of vs beeing in durance, haue for many yeares endured, and as we hope without reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the bitter ſtormes of reſtraint and perſecution, and therfore in iuſtice ſhould deſerue at the leaſt, an eaſie &amp; indifferent cenſure, of ſuch as either cannot,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9135:6"/> or do not, heare vs anſwer for our ſelues. And that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome of our brethren as forward in diſlike and diſclaiming from ſuch proceedings as we be (if not more forward) haue ended their peregrination and troubles, with moſt glorious martyrdome, giuing a great teſtimony thereby of their ſincere intentions in ſuch matters they tooke in hand, and leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them alſo, a good motiue vnto you, to cenſure and iudge no leſſe of the intentions of others, whoſe caſes are the ſame with theirs, that they deale ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and according to conſcience. And becauſe you cannot perhaps enter into a iuſt iudgement of theſe matters, not ſeeing into the depth, drift, and circumſtances thereof, wee deſire no more at your hands, but that you will as yet ſuſpend your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vs, and not vncharitably condemne vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you ſee the concluſion and period of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which will manifeſt the truth of all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we deſire you to conſider our preſent eſtate in this buſineſſe how we ſtand, that we haue and do vowe all obedience vnto Gods Church, and do acknowledge &amp; embrace all authoritie lawfully proceeding from the See Apoſtolicke, and are moſt readie to ſhewe all obedience therevnto, when we ſhall ſee and know by iuſt and ordinary Canonicall notice, what it is that the authoritie of that See ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth at our hands, which no Chriſtian Catholicke can deny to be ſufficient, and as much as can in right and reaſon be deſired at our hands. And if we beleeue not euery Letter, Meſſenger, or report,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9135:6"/> onely deliuered vs by ſuch who are parties in this cauſe, and maiſter actors in erecting of this vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and obtruded authoritie, doo not blame vs; for we haue reaſon not to beleeue them in all things, much leſſe in matters of ſuch weight and ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, whom by experience we haue found dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in many things, and whom we knowe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend further matters hereby, then are ſeene or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined of many. And yet in this, ſtand we but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our owne right, in not yeelding: becauſe we expect but ordinary authenticall proofe of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary iuriſdiction, neuer denied in matters of farre leſſe moment and weight then this.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider what reaſon we haue to yeeld vnto this authoritie, not onely gotten by wrong and falce information and inſtance of the aduerſe part onely againſt our willes, without our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; contrary to all equitie and iuſtice; but alſo eſtabliſhed in ſuch ſort by them, that the ſuperiour muſt needes remaine a punie, and inferiour to them, and by that meane be an inſtrument to execute what they ſhall thinke good or fit to be done; ſo that our ſuperiour being ſubiect vnto them, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all we muſt be their apprentizies, and ſtand at their commaund, which is to peruert all true or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Gods Church. For oftentimes, and by the late generall Councell of <hi>Trident,</hi> it is decreed, that the ſecular Cleargie ſhall haue power ouer the Religious, as to viſite them, reforme and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, &amp;c. as the Biſhop dooth, but ſeldome or neuer hath the Religious Cleargie any iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction

For why? they haue vowed obedience, and therefore ſhould not ſeeke for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And that theſe men haue ſought for ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer vs their poore brethren, it is moſt euident by their ſeueral enterpriſes to that end made amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the priſoners of <hi>Wisbiche:</hi> &amp; that now alſo they ſeeke the ſame againe, and more generally by this new au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Arch-prieſt, is no leſſe euident the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former, to them that will ſee any thing; elſe, why ſhould they ſo earneſtly buſie themſelues in a thing no whit at all concerning them, and much vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to others, as to prouide and place a Superiour ouer vs, who pertaine not to their charge, and that againſt our wills, and without our knowledge or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto, not ſo much as demaunding our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions thereof before hande. And when they haue done that, by fauours, perſwaſions, and increaſing of faculties, intyce and allure men to ratifie by ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what they cunningly haue wrought vnderha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; &amp; to ſuch as refuſe to ſubſcribe, to threaten Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, ſuſpenſion, taking away of faculties, and denounce them ſchiſmatikes, irregular, &amp;c: and by Letters diſgrace them in places where they come, and giue warning of them as of ſchiſmatikes, &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate perſons. And more, to ſhewe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in this matter, what intereſt they ſeeke and chalenge in this authoritie, though indeed nothing concerning them, becauſe a diſtinct ſocietie and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die from vs; one of them in a Letter hee wrote vnto<note place="margin">F.

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:9135:7"/> one that would not ſubſcribe, confeſſeth &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that whatſoeuer is oppoſite to the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Arch-prieſt, muſt of force, be conſequently, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite &amp; againſt them, which thing muſt of neceſſitie import an extraordinary tye betweene the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Arch-prieſt &amp; them: either of the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them vnto the Arch-prieſt, which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime from &amp; deny, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe of the Archprieſt to them, elſe how muſt it of neceſſitie follow, that he which is oppoſite vnto the Arch-prieſts authoritie, muſt of force be oppoſite to them, as though a man might not reſiſt the Superiour of an order, but hee muſt needs therby oppoſe himſelf againſt the whole body of an other order? Furthermore, if their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt were not great in this authoritie, why ſhould they be ſo vnwilling to procure, or ſuffer to be procured, ſome Bull or Breue, for the confirmation therof, that it might be an abſolute and independent authoritie? but that hanging at the will and order of the Lorde Cardinall Protector only, they bearing a great ſway with him as we know they doo, may keep the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt in awe, that hee ſhall dare to doo nothing that may diſpleaſe them, for feare they ſhould informe againſt him to the Cardinall, and ſo thruſt him out of office: which they could not doo, were his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie confirmed once by any Apoſtolicall writte: and this onely is the cauſe they loue not to heare of Bull or Brieue in this authoritie, if otherwiſe they can chooſe; for by this meanes the Arch-prieſt ſtanding in awe of them, we muſt ſtand alſo at the reuerſion of their courteſies in any matter of queſtion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9135:8"/> that may ariſe amongſt vs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly conſider, that by yeelding vnto this preſent authoritie erected and directed by them, we ſhall be drawne within the compaſſe and perill of all plottes and actions whatſoeuer, in matters of ſtate practiſed by them, or any of them, or hereafter ſhall be practiſed at any time by them, and ſo not we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo ſuch with whom we ſhall conuerſe, and thoſe which ſhall concurre with vs in this action, ſhal be brought into more danger of the extremitie &amp; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the lawes, then otherwiſe we ſhould, in that the authoritie is alreadie thought by the Counſell to be of purpoſe erected for the better effecting of ſuch deſignements; and ſo ſhall we, being brought within the compaſſe of other mens actions, be hanged for kingdomes and matters of ſtate, and the glory of our cauſe therby diminiſhed, if not cleane extinguiſhed, to ſatisfie other mens pleaſures &amp; ſerue their turnes. Beſides al this, by the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of diuers men of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the lawes of our Country, this our caſe may and will be drawne within the compaſſe of an olde law enacted, aſwel by our Catholick Biſhops &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, as by the Prince, aboue 300. yeares agoe, vz. the lawe of Premunire; becauſe it is an externall iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction brought into this realme, againſt the will &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Prince &amp; Country, which made the late reuerend Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> Doctor <hi>Watſon,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe all externall iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offered him ouer his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low priſoners, although once he had lawfull Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall iuriſdiction within the Realme, and was vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully depriued thereof.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:9135:8"/>
            <p>Fitfthly conſider we beſeech you, for the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your conſciences in this moſt vniuſt &amp; ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous report made againſt vs of ſchiſme, that there can be no ſchiſme, where there is a reſigned will of obedience. We proteſt and vow all obedience due vnto Gods Church, and all her lawfull authoritie, and therefore can be made no ſchiſmatikes poſſibly. If they vrge againſt vs that we obey not this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: let them ſhewe vs that it is a lawfull act of the Church and we obey. If they tell vs of Letters from the Cardinal, we anſwer them, that no man is bound to beleeue the Cardinall himſelfe without Bull or Breue, in matters of ſo large co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence concerning the Church. What reaſon then is there that his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bare Letters, the contents wherof drew on ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral &amp; extreme perſecution vpon our necks, ſhould be allowed of by vs, as a ſufficient proofe of the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation? If they ſay that the Cardinall is a perſon of ſingular credit, and not to be diſtruſted, we anſwere them, that we impeach not his credit, ſtanding onely vpon our owne right and iuſtice for our full ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his holines, of his abſolute will &amp; pleaſure herein, whoſe leaſt commaund ſhall euer binde vs, though with hazard or loſſe of our liues. To thinke that his holineſſe accounteth vs ſo baſe and abiect a Cleargy, or ſo vnworthy members of Gods church, that we deſerue not his ordinary notice in matters of ſo great moment, which is but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proceſſe in matters of farre leſſe weight proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that See, were both in it ſelf ridiculous, &amp; iniurious alſo to his holines. We could alſo vrge, that his hol. as yet hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9135:9"/> had no informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all from vs, (our meſſengers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preuented of audience, &amp; clapped in cloſe priſon by Father <hi>Perſons</hi> procurement) but onely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, who are but one and the aduerſe part in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, which you know is againſt all right and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and in which caſe, being but a matter of fact, his Holi. for want of due &amp; ſufficient information, may proceed with error, to the preiudice of the innocent part, although vnwillingly, and by him not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: in which caſe Appellations alwaies are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for further information in matters thus in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Conſider now ſincerely deare Catholickes, theſe reaſons propounded, and enter not too too raſhly into condemnation of vs your ſpirituall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, who haue alreadie in part, and are ſtil readie, to ſpend our bloud for your ſakes: but haue patience with vs a little, vntil you ſee the end of theſe matters, and the iudgements of his Holineſſe herein, which we hope you ſhall ſhortly ſee, and perhappes in the ende, you ſhall finde that we, whom by ſiniſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations and ſuggeſtions, you are now ready alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to condemne, haue bene, and are your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt friends in withſtanding ſuche proceedings, as haply may concern your ſelues as neare, if not more neare, then vs, although you perceiue not, nor ſee ſo much.

            <head>Other reaſons to the ſame purpoſe by another, vnder the forme of a Letter.</head>
            <p>SYr, your priuate occaſions which you recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to my care, I haue ſo tendered, that euery thing is as forward as any diligence of mine can ſet it, and in my laſt haue explaned to the full, the courſe I tooke, which I truſt is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections you ſent mee, and will I hope haue the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe that both you and I deſire. The progreſſe of the matter you ſhall vnderſtand as occaſion ſerueth. In the end of your Letter, you make mention of a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion lately growne amongſt vs, who ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of loue and vnion, and laments the bitter fruites ſprung thereof, as pernicious to many a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſoule. Whereof diuers friends of mine by name are charged to be ſome cauſe, for that they were not ready at firſt to yeeld to the late authoritie of Maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> nor as yet can be brought to acknowledge the ſame. Truly Syr, for that you are my friend, and I throughly acquainted with the origine &amp; proceſſe of the difference, I thought it my part, for your better information, &amp; diſcharge of my blameleſſe friends, briefly to ſet downe what is done in this matter, and vpon what ground, and then to leaue the cenſure of it to your prudent conſideration.</p>
            <p>To build ſure, I lay this foundation; that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pietie nor true obedience, at the firſt ſight to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any authoritie but ſuch as is orderly procured, and lawfully promulgated, in ſuch ſort that ſubiects
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9135:10"/> may remaine morally ſure, that it proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true fountaine of ſuperioritie truly enformed, which of it ſelfe is ſo manifeſt that it needeth no proofe; for the contrary were to open the way to all forgeries and intruſions: and in fine, the ouerthrow of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall proceedings. Here hence followeth; that which true prudence and vertue doo dictate: that when any new and extraordinary authoritie is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, they whom it concerneth; before that by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance they approue it, ſhould of dutie looke and examine whether it be accompanied with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions aboue mentioned, and ſo admit or reiect it, as diſcretion &amp; conſcience ſhall require. To the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in both theſe conditions of lawfull authoritie, this we ſpeake of is feared to hault, and not without great preſumption. And for that to handle both at large would exceed the limits of a Letter; and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in either, doth ſufficiently warrant their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, I wil leaue the firſt, (for that muſt needs touch particular perſons and their actions: which without further occaſion and very iuſt, I am loath to do) and ſhew briefly how the manner of promulgation is in no way ſufficient, but rather full of ſuſpition, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth iuſt occaſion of diſtruſt.</p>
            <p>And firſt the credit of this promulgation, dooth wholly hang vpon their credits, who taketh autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie vpon them, who for that they are parties in this action, may iuſtly be ſuſpected as partiall in their owne cauſe, which cannot chooſe but leaue the matter doubtfull in any indifferent mind: or ſuch at leaſt as no man is in conſcience bounde to beleeue.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9135:10"/> Againe, put caſe they were lawfulll promulgators, yet they bring nothing ſufficient to ordaine ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie or iuriſdiction: to erect ſuch an authoritie, cannot be leſſe then an expreſſe commaundent of his Holineſſe: and giuen for this particular purpoſe. And the ſame alſo authentically notified of al which the aduerſe part ſheweth nothing, for neither do they challenge any ſuch expreſſe decree from his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but onely order giuen to the Cardinal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, to take vp our controuerſies and iarres here, which is nothing to build ſuch an extraordinary ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie vpon: or if they did, we are not to giue full credit to the Cardinall his bare word, in a matter of ſo great weight: ſeeing that in ſuch buſineſſe he hath heretofore bene founde ouermuch affected to the one part, who haue their finger and hand in theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and for this reaſon hath bene excepted againſt as vnfit to iudge in ſuch cauſes, that ſo neare concern thoſe parties as theſe things do, therefore theſe men demaund but right, if they require an authenticall inſtrument from his holines to ſpecifie his will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and in the meane while determine nothing, but reſt ready to imbrace whatſoeuer his holines ſhal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there are now 8. or 9. moneths paſt, ſith firſt the authoritie was diuulged, &amp; ſithence the lawfulnes therof, for the reaſons aboue mentioned and diuers others was doubted of, as not proceeding from his holines: yet the maintainers notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hotte, eager, &amp; earneſt courſe that they take in defence of it, would neuer obtaine the leaſt ticket,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9135:11"/> or teſtimony vnder his holineſſe hand, or directly from him, in confirmation of it: nor yet to notefie that euer any ſuche matter was appointed by him; knowing that ſuch a note woulde haue ended the whole controuerſie. And this maketh men in their mindes to queſtion with themſelues in this ſort: doo not theſe men by ordinary courſe, monethly or oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner receiue Letters from <hi>Rome?</hi> hath not Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> weekely, yea daily acceſſe to his holineſſe as other Cardinalls haue? doo they want fauour with him who is wholly theirs; or his forwardnes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that himſelfe hath either begunne or followed; and for the credit whereof, hee hath graunted what Letters themſelues would requeſt, and as effectuall as themſelues could drawe them? or would his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe refuſe to teſtifie that he is the appointer of this authoritie if it had proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him? No, no, there is cunning ſome where, which when matters are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered will quickly appeare. And this is confirmed with another preſumption of no leſſe moment then the former. For when theſe friends of mine by vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme conſent of many of their owne brethren, wiſe and learned, &amp; the auncienteſt, had reſolued peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly to ſend ouer to knowe the Popes pleaſure in this matter, they ſent to the contrary part, to intreat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue ſo much patience as to expect what anſwere theſe meſſengers did receiue from his holineſſe: and if matters proued to be ſo as they ſaid they were, then without further reſiſtance, euery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ready to ioyne with them, &amp; to reſiſt whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhould reſiſt them: and ſo the whole matter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9135:11"/> might haue bene very briefly and quietly ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelues in loue and charitie, without ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall or hurt to any.</p>
            <p>But this ſo reaſonable a requeſt could not be heard, but as if they had feared ſome preſent daunger now after ſending, they poſted about more earneſtly then euer before, ſend abroad papers, threaten excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, promiſe fauours, abuſe the laitie with infamous reports of their brethren, ſending into all quarters of the countrey to begge hands and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions: and where any for what iuſt cauſe ſoeuer did refuſe, their meanes open or ſecret were deuiſed to ſupplant and diſgrace them, and accuſations for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to withdraw their lay friends, and conſequently their maintenance from them. Which muſt needes conſtraine the wronged to defend and cleare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues euen with the ſame lay-friends; &amp; ſo the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grew to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention, &amp; became publikely knowne amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Laitie, that women &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do tattle and deſcant euery where, and paſſe their cenſure therof. And what followeth of this, euery body may ſee, and it is too lamentable to ſpeake or write, what hurt our cauſe hath ſuſtained hereby.</p>
            <p>But what good I pray you did theſe men pretend by ſo hurtfull a courſe? Was the Pope ſo deſirous of thankes that it muſt be procured with ſuch broyles? I cannot thinke it. Certes it maketh men iuſtly to miſtruſt, that there is a further matter intended then in ſhewe they pretend: and that theſe hands &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions by ſuch meanes and ſo carefully procured to be ſent ouer in ſuch haſte, muſt ſerue to ſalue and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9135:12"/> heale ſomewhat that is not ſound there: happily to draw the Pope to conſent to that which perchance he neuer heard or allowed of, and ſo heereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine men to put too their hands, ſaying it is his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe will they ſhould doo ſo, and there perſwade the Pope to allow of it, for that it is the Prieſts volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary requeſt &amp; ſute here. By which meanes no doubt but that they may eaſily procure the Popes confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; who is and hath bene ready to referre the chooſing of the ſuperiour to the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> as Father <hi>Perſons</hi> himſelfe can witneſſe: which was the cauſe that at the beginning when ſuch a matter was propoſed to his holineſſe: he would not proceed in it without they agreed &amp; conſented alſo, as there is great reaſon for him. For whoſe aduiſe, conſent, and allowance, are required to the chooſing of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, if not theirs that are to obey and liue vnder the ſaid ſuperiour, when he is choſen? do not the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in euery houſe in <hi>Oxenford</hi> (and according to the ſtatutes and foundation) chooſe and elect their head and Rector? Do not likewiſe all the religious companies chooſe their ſuperiour? Nay do not the<note place="margin">

If he haue, then to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie wherein perchance he might be miſinformed, that therby he may the better redreſſe what is amiſſe; or if after due information, his wiſedome ſhall think the courſe taken, to be for the benefite of our cauſe and countrey, then they carry a mind proſtrate both<note place="margin">How then could their delay be ſchiſme, they being alike ready to obey.</note> for themſelues, and in the name of the reſt that ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them in this action, to accept and obey whatſoeuer the Apoſtolicall ſea ſhall herein decree.

            <head>Maiſter <hi>Champneyes</hi> Letter of the ſame argument, to a Reuerend friend of his.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ery Reuerend Syr, As from my very cradle I acknowledge my ſelf many wayes beholding vnto you, for your manifold courteſies, both towards me and other of my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friends; ſo haue I had alwaies a ſpeciall deſire, to yeeld ſuch corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence in my demeanour, as I might neither giue you, nor any other of my friends, iuſt occaſion to withdraw from me their friendly affection. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe I gather by ſome ſpeeches that paſſed not long ſince, betweene you and a friend of yours and mine, that you haue conceiued a worſe opinion of mee, then wittingly I haue deſerued, or willingly would deſerue. The ſiniſter reports of ſome, whoſe endeuours are different from their profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing cauſed in you, not onely a ſurmiſe, but as it ſeemeth, a ſtrong and firme opinion, that I am diſobedient to the See Apoſtolicke, and enemy to the Fathers of the ſocietie, and a contemner of the late authoritie of our Arch-prieſt. Theſe be the crymes wherewith I ſuppoſe, both my ſelfe and diuers others are taxed, (or truer) moſt iniuriouſly ſlaundered. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very vnwilling to permit you to remaine in that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9135:14"/> opinion grounded vpon mere fictions and falſities, I determined to make mine Apologie with you, and to yeeld you reaſon for all my proceedings in theſe matters: which being weighed in the equal ballance of your indifferent iudgement, I nothing doubt but it will yeeld you full ſatisfaction, and giue you ſome light to ſee how you haue hitherto beene abuſed by falſe informers. I know it to be a difficult thing ſo to take away and remoue, out of a mature minde, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which hath long without contradiction poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, ſo to take it away I ſay, as there remaine no ſcruple nor doubt thereof. Yet when I doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider on the one ſide, your graue and ſincere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, voyd (as I verily thinke) of all partialitie: and on the other ſide, the cleareneſſe and manifeſt truth of the matter I am to ſpeake of; I cannot almoſt doubt but ſo to ſatisfie theſe obiected crimes, as that you will eaſily ſee, both my ſelfe and others, to haue ſuffered mightie wrong by the raiſers thereof.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore good ſir, craue onely this of you, that you will not meaſure that which I ſhall ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preiudiciall opinion which you haue already framed of my perſon; for ſo ſhall you eaſily preiudice the equitie of my Plea: but let your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceed of the thing it ſelfe, without reſpect either to my perſon or any other, and ſo being voyd of affection, ſhall it bee more free from errour. If I ſay any thing that may leane vppon humaine creditte as matters of narration or fact, I deſire to bee beleeued no further, then I can manifeſtly proue.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9135:14"/> If I vtter matters of opinion or iudgement, as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or reaſons for any fact, I deſire no more, then that they be meaſured according to the weight and truth they do containe. This is ſo indifferent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that if I ſhould doubt the graunting thereof, I ſhould in mine opinion, offer you no ſmall wrong. I will therefore Sir, deteine you no longer with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable circuits of wordes, but I will come to the matter: and whatſoeuer I ſhall ſay in mine owne behalfe in this affaire, you may vnderſtand it of others that bee of the ſame opinion with mee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>The former accuſations, to weete, that I am diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the ſee Apoſtolicke, an aduerſary to the Fathers, and an impugner of our Arch-prieſts autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, are all grounded vpon one and the ſelfe-ſame foundation; which I thinke, I ſhall eaſily ſhewe to be both friuolous and falſe, and conſequently ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe whatſoeuer is built therevpon: howſoeuer ſome men do labour to fortifie the ſame, not by the probabilitie of any reaſon, or equall debating the matter, but by confidence, or rather impudent infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of ſuch as labour to defend the truth.</p>
            <p>All theſe accuſations therfore are forged vpon this one principle, becauſe forſoothe I did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge M. <hi>Blackwells</hi> authoritie vpon the receit onely of Cardinall <hi>Caietaines</hi> Letters: wherein he affirmed that the Pope had giuen vnto him, authoritie to appoint a gouernment ouer the Seminary Prieſts in <hi>England.</hi> For this cauſe I am ſaide to reſiſt the Popes authoritie: and becauſe the Ieſuites were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9135:15"/> the procurers of this delegation, therfore am I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their aduerſary, becauſe I did not accept of the thing and meanes to eſtabliſh it, which they thought good of: And laſtly, becauſe I did not acknowledge M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> for my Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiour, vpon the forementioned teſtimonie, I am ſaid to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugner of his authoritie.</p>
            <p>Loe Syr, here is the whole ground of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer accuſations, neither doo I thinke they laie any thing elſe to my charge: If they doo, when I may know it, I will either ſatisfie their obiections, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my fault and errour. In the mean while, I would to God that they who do accuſe me of theſe or whatſoeuer crimes, would ſtand to the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any indifferent Iudge: ſuch a Iudge I meane as hath intereſt neither in them, nor in me: that his ſentence might be voide of all partialitie; moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would I binde my ſelfe to the iudgement of ſuch a one, and if I were conuicted, I would make ſuch ſatisfaction, as the ſame Iudge ſhould preſcribe. But I know it is not the guiſe of mine aduerſaries to admit any ſuch tryall; for vnleſſe they may be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, informers, and Iudges too, they will ſtand to no arbitrement. Wherefore to omit this indifferent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, becauſe I am in diſpaire to obtaine the grant thereof, I will by ſhewing mine owne innocencie, make plaine what open iniurie and apparant wrong is offered me.</p>
            <p>The firſt accuſation wherevpon the other do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and therefore that anſwered, the other muſt needs alſo be ſatisfied, hath ſo ſmall proofe or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9135:15"/> in it, as I cannot but wonder how any man of indifferent iudgement, vnderſtanding the ſtate of the matter, ſhould be induced to conforme his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thervnto. For to diſobey, is to reſiſt, contemne, or impugne the knowne commaund of a ſuperiour. To be a ſchiſmatique, is wilfully to deuide himſelfe from the vnitie of the head as head; or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the bodie, as ſubordinate to the head of gods Church. Theſe propoſitions are of themſelues eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: but if any doubt of them, let him looke. S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> touching the firſt. 22. <hi>q. 104. ar.</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>q. 105. per to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Touching the ſecond, 22. <hi>q. 39. ar.</hi> 1. and <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, ibidem.</hi> Theſe principles being admitted, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that any ſcholler, though but meanely learned, ſhould perſwade himſelfe, that I did either diſobey the Popes holineſſe, or incurre any ſchiſmaticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, by not admitting M. <hi>Blackwells</hi> authoritie, vpon the onely teſtimonie of Cardinall <hi>Caietanes</hi> Letters. But I perceiue there is no paradox ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that will not finde ſome approuers. I ſay therefore, that his holineſſe will, was not ſufficiently notified by thoſe Letters, to make the refuſall of the ordinances conteined therein, either diſobedience or ſchiſme, which I prooue by manifold examples. Put the caſe therefore, that ſome one of our Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie here in England, ſhould addreſſe his Letters into Ireland, or ſome place of England furtheſt diſtant from the Princes abode, in which Letters he ſhould ſignifie, that he had receiued authoritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, to ordaine and eſtabliſh in that Country, what gouernment he thinketh beſt, and together, ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9135:16"/> ſuch a gouernment, as was neuer heard of in that Countrey, or any other, and this without any other teſtimony or proofe of his authority, beſides his own Letters.</p>
            <p>This caſe being thus put moſt like vnto ours (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely that ſome circumſtances are omitted for breuities ſake, that make more for our aduantage) I would demaund of theſe that accuſe me and my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren of ſchiſme, what theſe ſubiects ought to doo in this caſe. If they ſay that they ought to obey the Noble mans writ, and to admit ſuch a Magiſtrate as hee dooth appoint them, how diſcommodious ſoeuer it ſeemeth to their Common wealth, and how diſagreeing ſoeuer it bee from the forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of their knowne Prince: they will binde them to ſo many and imminent inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences, that in truth I thinke they wil not auouch ſuch an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability. For firſt this would be to enforce them to incurre euident daunger of rebellion towards their knowne Prince, by admitting an vſurper: for it may be, notwithſtanding his owne word, that he hath no ſuch authoritie: yea though the Prince ſhould truly giue vnto him that authority, yet the ſubiects hauing no other notice of it but only his own Letters and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, they ſhould be ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rebelling againſt their Prince by deferring to admit his ordinances, till they had more perfect intelligence of theyr Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will; that they ſhould be accounted both pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and loyall for ſo dooing: and for the contrary, they ſhould worthily be condemned of fooliſh leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if not of open conſpiracie.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:9135:16"/>
            <p>For if they ſhould bee called to account, and bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by whoſe authoritie or commaundement they changed their gouernment, wil any man thinke it ſhoulde bee a ſufficient warrant, to ſay by ſuch a Lords Letters, ſpecifying no other teſtimony of his authoritie, but his owne? I cannot thinke that any woulde beleeue that aunſwere ſufficient to excuſe them, at leaſt from ſuſpition of diſloyaltie, ſeeing in this caſe, they ſhould be no more excuſeable, though he had true authoritie, then if he had none at all.</p>
            <p>An other inconuenience which theſe ſubiects ſhould infallibly run into is, that hereby they ſhould open the way to euery ambitious or ſeditious perſon to chalenge the ſame priuiledge, to haue his owne teſtimony admitted, whenſoeuer he ſhould ſay, hee hath authoritie from the Prince, to ordaine what he liſt. Which who ſeeth not what a heape of inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences it bringeth with it; and theſe not following chance or accident; but out of the very nature of the thing it ſelfe, ſuppoſing the corruption of humaine frailtie, which no man can take away: which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs alſo do neceſſarily follow vpon the admiſſion of ſuch a pretended authoritie for the time onely, vntil better certainty may be procured, either for the eſtabliſhing or reiecting of the ſame.</p>
            <p>But if they ſay, that theſe ſubiects ought to reiect this obtruded and vncertaine authoritie, as a thing voyd of all lawful and cuſtomary proceeding in ſuch affaires, &amp; not without great probability of fraud and euident ſuſpition of ſurreption, they ſhal ſpeak more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formably to reaſon, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſence, &amp; practice, both in ciuill and eccleſiaſticall gouernment.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9135:17"/> But if they will auoid both theſe extreames (wherof the latter without all compariſon is more ſecure, and doubtleſſe of it ſelfe moſt lawfull) and ſay that theſe ſubiects ought at leaſt not abſolutely to deny the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of his authoritie, but to delaie till more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit notice be giuen. If, I ſay, they affirme this, we will yeeld it vnto them; yea, and that the ſaide ſubiects, which is much more, are bound of their owne coſt and labours, to ſeeke the further knowledge of their Princes will: and then I demaund of them what of all this, I &amp; my brethren haue offended, whereby we ſhuld deſerue the note of ſchiſmatiques, rebels, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or the like Epithetons, which they moſt prodigally beſtow vpon vs. But if they can neither proue nor yet ſhew any diſparitie in the caſe, which of it ſelfe ſeemeth to be too too cleare, I cannot tell how they will auoide the fowle note of ſlaunderers and detractours, who haue by word and writing, in England, Flaunders, Italy; &amp; where elſe they come, accuſed vs of ſchiſme, rebellion, ſedition, and the like.</p>
            <p>Two diſparities, peraduenture, they will alledge in the caſe: Firſt, that I put the caſe in ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereas it ought to be in Eccleſiaſticall. The ſecond, that I put the caſe in one that is not knowne to haue any ordinary authoritie in theſe affaires, whereas it is contrary in our caſe, the Cardinall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Protector of our Nation. But both theſe are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſeely ſhifts, not worthie of any anſwere. For firſt the inconueniences that do follow in the caſe before propoſed, doo follow by ſo much more euidently in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9135:17"/> Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, by howe much more large the precincts of the Popes iuriſdiction are, and further from the place of his abode, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any one temporal Prince, and by how much leſſe ſenſible ordinarily, and more ſpirituall Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall puniſhment is, then is the temporall, for ſuch vſurpers. The ſecond is as friuolous; for albeit Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Caietaine</hi> was our Protectour, and alſo Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet is it euident, that by neither of theſe offices, hee had any ordinary Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall iuriſdiction ouer our Cleargie, eſpecially to erect any new gouernment: and therefore if hee had any authoritie in this matter, it muſt needs be deligate and extraordinary: and conſequently, was as well to notifie vnto vs the ſame, by ſome ſufficient teſtimonie beſides his owne word, as the Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of England is to ſhewe his warrant, if he intend to take vpon him the office of the high Martiall, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other not perteining to the Chauncellourſhip.</p>
            <p>But they wil further obiect, that to deny or doubt of that which the Cardinall affirmeth, is to call his credit into queſtion, whoſe authoritie ought to be ſufficient teſtimonie for whatſoeuer hee ſaith: this is their maine obiection, and as it were their <hi>Achilles,</hi> whereby they would prooue vs all ſciſmatiques. But firſt this argument concludeth not. For ſuppoſe that we did offend in not admitting nor beleeuing his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony for the inſtituting of this new authoritie, yet it followeth not that we ſhould therfore be ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, but at the moſt, that we ſinned againſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine credit, which cannot be ſchiſme, as by it ſelfe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9135:18"/> is verie euident. But that we neither offend in this manner, it ſhall appeare by the two laſt anſweres to this obiection; and that we committed not any act of diſobedience, by denying to obey the Cardinalls ordinances, it is verie cleare: for it is a farre different thing for any one to deny obedience to him whom he knoweth or beleeueth to be his ſuperiour, and to deny it to him whom he probably thinketh is not his ſuperiour, eſpecially if he do it therefore onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thinketh him not to bee his ſuperiour; of which two, onely the firſt is properly diſobedience: the ſecond is neither diſobedience nor any other ſin, if it proceed of an opinion as probable, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable then the contrary, much leſſe when it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of certaine truth as in our caſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly I ſay, that they muſt alſo anſwere this obiection, if they admit the caſe put before: for if we were bounde to obey Cardinall <hi>Caietaines</hi> ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon his owne Letters onely, then ſhould the ſubiects before mentioned, be bound to do the ſame in that caſe, and ſo ſhould follow all the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences mentioned.</p>
            <p>Thirdly I ſay, that it is not any offence to denie that vnto any one, that is not due vnto him; but it cannot be due vnto any man thogh in neuer ſo great honour, to haue his owne teſtimony admitted for the acknowledging of that authoritie which he hath not of himſelfe but from an other, for otherwiſe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in honour might chalenge the ſame, and ſo bring confuſion in all gouernments.</p>
            <p>Fourthly I ſay, that the authoritie whereby an act of publicke office is practiſed in any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9135:18"/> either ciuil or Eccleſiaſticall, requireth a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall or iuridicall proofe, to make it authenticall. Which kind of proofe or teſtimonie, is not required in any other humaine action; for we ſee that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of an ordinarie perſon may be ſufficient for the Iudge, with helpe of other ſtrong coniectures, to pronounce a partie guiltie or vnguiltie: and yet the Iudge himſelfe muſt ſhewe other warrant for his authoritie then his owne word, or elſe his ſentence cannot binde, thorow default of the vncertaintie of his iuriſdiction, though he be otherwiſe of neuer ſo great honour: neither is this any diſparagement to his credit, the nature and ſtate of the thing requiring it. The like is in all other actions of publique autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as it is manifeſt by all experience. For albeit, to conuince a man of treaſon or fellonie, is a greater matter in it ſelfe, then it is for one to prooue that hee hath the authoritie of a Iudge, or of any other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke officer, yet the teſtimonie of priuate perſons, though otherwiſe of ſmall eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſerueth for that, and the Princes ſeale onely ſufficeth for the other. Which is not to be imputed to the credit of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties teſtifying, but to the condition of the thing teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for which cauſe it is verie abſurd, to ſay that the teſtimonie of any man though of neuer ſo great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is ſufficient in his owne cauſe to make proofe of the authoritie he claimeth, without concurrance of any other teſtimonie; for it is but his owne word, albeit his word would be abundantly ſufficient for the proofe of any other humaine matter, as one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For ſeeing that no man of himſelfe, I meane of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9135:19"/> his own perſon, hath anie iuriſdiction ouer an other: if anie man chalenge it, he muſt either ſhewe how he hath it, or elſe the other is not bound to beleeue him. As for example, <hi>Peter</hi> is no more bound to beleeue, that <hi>Iohn</hi> is his ſuperiour, then <hi>Iohn</hi> is to beleeue, that <hi>Peter</hi> is his; vnleſſe the one can ſhew it by ſome ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe beſides his owne teſtimonie, for in that they are not much different, although they differ in wealth or honour: which things authoritie, dooth not conſequently follow. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this point, I ſay, if the Cardinall had giuen his word or Letters in teſtimonie of anie truth, not involuing the vſe of authoritie, his teſtimonie would haue bene admitted without all exception; wherby it appeareth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was not want of due credit that hindred the admitting of his teſtimonie in our buſineſſe, but becauſe the nature of the thing it ſelf required other proofe: neither can our aduerſaries be ignorant of this, but that they are diſpoſed to contend without matter: for thoſe that will not denie the Sunne to be vp at noone day, cannot denie or doubt of this.</p>
            <p>And thus reuerend Sir, you ſee, that conteining our ſpeech within the compaſſe that the verie ſtate and condition of the thing requireth, how farre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection hath ledde them beyond all ſence &amp; reaſon, that haue condemned their bretheren of horrible ſchiſme, where there is not ſo much, as any litle ſhew or probabilitie thereof; though we do conſider the matter in all rigour, abſtracting from all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which being verie many and euident for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, make the thing more plaine and cleare.

Thirdly, it is againſt the very light of naturall reaſon, that a man who is of a diſtinct gouernment or body, ſhould bee the chiefe: yea, the onely elector and appoynter of the head and gouernour of an other body without the conſent thereof. As for a Benedictine Monke, to elect or appoint (for example) the head and generall of the Fathers of the ſocietie, and to thruſt him vpon them againſt their wills and conſents. Who euer heard of ſuch an abſurditie? Which in our caſe is by ſo much more apparant, by how many moe bad cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances concurre. Fourthly, the thing it ſelfe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth euident remonſtrance of an intollerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den without any commoditie at all, and not without manifeſt ſuſpition of a plaine plot or ſtratageme, to confound and take away all Eccleſiaſticall Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie and auncient approoued gouernment in our Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons, wherevnto I might adde many moe, if they be not ſo apparant to you, being thus wrapped vp as it were in a bundle, I ſhall if you giue me occaſion vnfold them, and make them as cleare as the noone-day. Which if they be but indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pondered, will not onely cleare vs from all ſchiſme and ſinne, but alſo conuince our accuſers of manifeſt badde dealing: who without all ſhewe of reaſon or iuſt cauſe, began the quarell, to the open ſcandall of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9135:20"/> the world; and yet do labour tooth and nayle to caſt the ſlaunder and ignomie thereof vppon ſuch as were onely defendants, and endeuoured to deliuer themſelues from manifeſt iniury.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe reaſons, and many moe which we had, not onely to deferre, but alſo vtterly to reiect this diſorderly procured gouernment: you ſhall now heare how peaceably and orderly we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the matter; and contrariwiſe, how turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and without all ſhewe of equitie, our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries dealt with vs. Which becauſe it requireth onely a narration of theſe things that haue actually paſſed betweene vs; I ſhall not need to alleadge any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by way of argument to conuince that which I ſhall ſay, but onely if any thing be denied, to call the world for a witneſſe of the truth. Neuertheleſſe I do not intend to rippe vp the matter from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for ſo I ſhould weary you with too long a ſpeech: but omitting the maner of proceeding vſed in the firſt procuring of this late ordeined gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was very exorbitant, and altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to reaſon, and the accuſtomed practiſe of Gods Church in ſuch affaires. I will begin with the firſt receiuing of Cardinall <hi>Caietaines</hi> Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we had firſt notice of this authoritie, and ſo chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate ſome chiefe occurrents that haue actually happened among vs ſince that time, whereby you ſhall eaſily ſee, whether we haue offered or ſuffered wrong.</p>
            <p>Vpon the firſt receit therefore of the Protectors Letters, after due conſideration of the tenour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9135:20"/> becauſe they conteined an ordinance vnheard of before in the Church of God, and that without any authoritie from his holineſſe, contrary to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall cuſtome and practiſe of that See. Wherevpon grew many doubts whether that proceeded from his holineſſe commaund or no; but that which moſt of all moued, was becauſe there appeared no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie that it proceeded from him truly informed of the ſtate and condition of our Countrey and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; neither the thing it ſelfe, nor the maner of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, yeelding any probabilitie of ſuch informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: wherevpon we thought it altogether repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline and gouernment, to admit any ſuch ordinances intangled with ſo many doubts. For which cauſe, we determined before we did admit this inſtitution, to procure more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge and notice of his holineſſe his will and pleaſure in this matter, with moſt firme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſolution and purpoſe, to admit whatſoeuer we ſhould certainely knowe to be his will, the ſtate of our Countrey firſt vnderſtood. For this cauſe we ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> two reuerend Prieſts, earneſtly reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> and the Fathers, the procurers of this authoritie, to be quiet in the meane while vntill the returne of our meſſengers, or ſome other ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent certitude came from <hi>Rome,</hi> that hee was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our ſuperiour: without full notice whereof, it was not poſſible to take away all doubts &amp; ſcruples, which would be the occaſions of great contentions and ſtrifes. But they vtterly refuſed to admit the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, ſaying, that it was diſobedience and rebellion to

But this improbable and ſenſeleſſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxe, they haue raiſed to cloake their manifold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries and wrongs practiſed againſt vs their innocent brethren, which if euer it be laid open to the view of the world, as peraduenture it may be, I thinke they will not paſſe without great admiration.</p>
            <p>Good Sir, heere I might make an ende, and thinke this ſufficient to diſcouer the falſitie of ſuch grounds, as haue bene and are ſtill with ſome, the foundations of ſuch ſlaunderous reports and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of deteſtable ſchiſme vniuſtly raiſed, and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably mainteined againſt mee and others of my bretheren: and that it might alſo ſuffice for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt ſuch vntrue &amp; vnchriſtian detractions, yet ſeeing I haue begunne, I will goe a litle further in declaring our innocency in this matter.</p>
            <p>Our Arch-prieſts authoritie being now of euery one admitted vpon the receit of his holineſſe Breue,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9135:22"/> and thereby all argument or ſhewe of ſchiſme, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, or rebellion, quite taken away (howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before matter was fained to vpholde ſo vncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible a fable) euery one of vs for peace and concords ſake, readie to remit the iniuries done vnto vs by publike ſlaunder of ſchiſme, publiſhed to the world in written pamphlets: and our Arch-prieſt writing his Letters, willing, and by his authoritie commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that no more ſpeech ſhould be made of matters paſt, but that euery one ſhould compoſe himſelfe to peace and vnitie with his brethren; the Fathers (who are not ſubiect to his authoritie, albeit they were the procurers thereof, for they loue to impoſe great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens vpon other mens ſhoulders, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues will not touch with one finger) perceiuing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that by this peaceable compoſition, there was like to enſue a continuall agreement amongſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſts, which they feared would be the baine of all their deſignements, they quickly deuiſed a way to breake this vnitie. For it is a principle with thoſe that ſeek dominion, to keep diuiſion alwaies among ſuch as they intend to bring vnder their regiment. To this purpoſe they renewed, as it ſhould ſeeme, the ſlaunder of ſchiſme, in more intollerable manner then before: for now they ſaid, that we were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſchiſmatikes, but that whoſoeuer ſhould <hi>dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zando,</hi> ſay the contrary, ſhould incurre the cenſures of holy church. And M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> himſelfe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his former prohibition (by their ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is more then probable) writ, that they had receiued a reſolution from the mother Citie, that we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9135:22"/> were ſchiſmatikes, and that in his opinion, we were not to be admitted to the Sacraments, without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction done for the ſame. Will any man now ſay, that theſe men deſire and ſeeke the peace &amp; tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of our afflicted Chuch? Can any one bee ſo ſhameleſſe as to avowe it? No, no. When therefore we perceiued our late compoſed peace, contrary to all expectation to be thus quickly broken, and that our good names began to bleed afreſh, the old gaules beeing not yet firmly cured: we requeſted of our Arch-prieſt that we might haue a parley or confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vpon the matters in controuerſie, with theſe conditions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that M. <hi>Garnet,</hi> M. <hi>Liſter,</hi> and whom, and how many ſoeuer of the ſocietie they ſhould thinke good to chooſe vnto them, to be reaſoners, deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or diſputers, on the one ſide, and of the other, three ſuch Prieſts of our company, as wee ſhould nominate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the groundes, reaſons, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, anſweres, and reioynders, on both ſides, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter full diſcuſſion &amp; agreement, ſhould be ſet downe in writing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the Vmperes or Arbitrators, to heare or determine of the weight, truth, and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all that ſhould be ſaid or alledged by either ſide, ſhould be 2. or 3. of the ſeniour Aſſiſtants, and M. <hi>Doleman,</hi> and that it ſhould be in the choiſe of our Arch-prieſt, to admit ſuch of the Laitie to be hearers of the diſpute, as to his wiſedome for the qualitie of the conference, ſhould ſeeme meete.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:9135:23"/>
            <p>Fourthly, that each of the Arbitrators, ſhould faithfully promiſe in the word of a Prieſt, to proceed to the giuing of ſentence vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proofe or diſproofe of either ſide, according to the <hi>dictamen</hi> of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and inward perſwaſion, without delay, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, mittigation, or partialitie.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that if the ſaid Arbitrators, ſhould iudge that our caſe was ſchiſme, and our ſelues ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, then we moſt humbly ſhould aske pardon on our knees of our Arch-prieſt and the ſocietie, for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto defending the contrary againſt the veritie of their affirmances. If of the other ſide, they ſhould cenſure or deeme that we were no ſchiſmatikes; then the ſocietie, eſpecially the penner and the approuers of the Pamphlet of ſchiſme, ſhould acknowledge their errour, reuerſe the tract, and make vs ſome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſatisfaction to the heape of iniuries &amp; infamies ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that it ſhould be lawfull without offence or prohibition, for either ſide after ſentence giuen and fulfilling of the premiſſes, to ſeeke, if it ſhould ſo pleaſe, a reſolution in the difference, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities beyond the ſeas, vpon ſhewe &amp; euidence of the ſaid diſpute, grounds, reaſons, proofes, &amp; arguments ſubſcribed, with the hands of the Vmperes &amp; diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of both ſides, to the end it might manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be the ſame, and no place left to the other ſide to ſuſpect any indirect dealing, either by adding, changing, or ſubtracting ought, too or from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; and that none of the foreſaid Arbitrators or diſputants, refuſe or deferre to put too his name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requeſted therevnto.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:9135:23"/>
            <p>Could you, good ſir, deuiſe more equall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then theſe? Or if theſe men did not intend to maintaine continuall brawles and ſtrifes, would they not haue admitted them? there being no more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meanes to end all controuerſies. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this ſo reaſonable and indifferent an offer; they tearmed it a tumultuous or rebellious demand, and commaunded that none vnder paine of ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhould either by word or writing, defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from being a ſchiſmaticke, wherby we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from defending our own good name vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away.</p>
            <p>Finding therfore our ſelues in theſe miſeries, that we muſt either looſe our good names, or by aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to defend them, incurre ſome high diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we ſet downe the ſtate of the controuerſie, and ſent it to the Doctours of the famous Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> requeſting their opinion and cenſure therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For although wee knew our ſelues altogether cleare from all contagion of ſchiſme, yet becauſe we would not be our owne Iudges, leaſt peraduenture wee might bee ſuſpected of partialitie in our owne cauſe, we ſent to haue their opinions, who are free from ſuſpition of all partialitie.

                     <p>In the yeare of our Lord, 1600. vpon the third day of May, it was propoſed to the facultie of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> that by the Letters of a moſt Illuſtrious Cardinall, an Eccleſiaſticall Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour was conſtituted in a certaine Kingdome, with the tytle and dignitie of an Arch-prieſt, to haue authoritie and iuriſdiction ouer all other Prieſts reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in that Kingdome. This Cardinall did alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in thoſe his Letters, that he did it according to the will and good liking of the Pope. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many of theſe Prieſts refuſed to ſubſcribe to the authoritie of the ſaid Arch-prieſt, before he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Letters from the See Apoſtolicke conteining the tenour of his confirmation, as well becauſe that kind of gouernment was altogether new in Gods Church, and hetherto neuer heard of, that an Arch-Prieſt ſhould haue charge of a whole kingdome, and ſuch iuriſdiction ouer euery Prieſt in that Realme:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9135:25"/> then alſo for that it ſeemed to them by certain words of the Cardinalls Letters, that the Arch-prieſt and his authoritie was graunted by falſe information; then laſtly becauſe they noted great partialitie in the choiſe of the Arch-prieſt and of his counſellors. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which and ſome other reaſons, theſe Prieſts ſent Meſſengers to the Pope, for laying open vnto him theſe their difficulties, and therewithall to ſignifie their greateſt readineſſe, as in this matter, ſo euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in all other, to obey his holineſſe.</p>

            <p>This we ſhewed to our Arch-prieſt, who, that he might leaue no way vnattempted to iniurie vs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited all Prieſts vnder paine of ſuſpenſion from the Altar, and loſſe of all their faculties, and Laie-men, vnder paine of being interdicted <hi>ipſefacto,</hi> to defend directly, or indirectly, the cenſure &amp; opinion of the Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> whether it were giuen by true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation or otherwiſe: which was not onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable iniurie vnto vs, prohibiting againſt the law of nature from defending our good names, but alſo an abſurd indignitie againſt ſo famous an Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I doo not knowe how any man could haue vſed more vnequall dealing. If our matter had bene ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently heard, and we condemned of a competent Iudge, theſe proceedings might haue ſome ſhewe of Iuſtice: but to proceede in this ſort with innocent men, for moderately defending their good names vniuſtly taken from them, they being altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard in the matter wherof they are accuſed: I think the like was neuer heard of amongſt Chriſtians, and much leſſe among Prieſts and Religious men.</p>
            <p>By theſe and the like violent dealings, both in theſe matters and others, wherof, beſide my ſelfe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9135:26"/> haue taſted abundantly; they haue giuen too too pregnant proofes of their further deſignements, if ſo that they can effect their purpoſe. For if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the manifold troubles of theſe times, they haue attempted &amp; put in practiſe ſuch violent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, truſting to their owne power, and not to any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quille: what will they not attempt, or what may we not expect, if future times and other opportunities be anſwerable to their deſires? Which deſires, if they be to Gods greater glory, &amp; more to the good of his Church, with my whole heart I wiſh they may take effect, &amp; that they may conſummate what they haue begunne. But verily their proceedings haue hitherto bene farre different, not onely from theirs who haue planted and watered the vineyard of Gods Church from the beginning, but alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theirs to whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other men, we ought moſt to attribute that hope we haue of the recouery of our poore Country to the Catholicke faith; namely Cardinall <hi>Allane,</hi> of moſt holie and happie memorie, whoſe life if it had pleaſed God to haue lent vs till this day, we ſhould haue had, if not in ſome ſort, a flouriſhing Church, yet a Church at leaſt without ſuch enormous diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtrife, and debate; a Church full of true ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, religious zeale, and fraternall charitie; for ſuch a one (God concurring to his holy endeuours) hee planted, and vntill his dying day, kept &amp; conſerued. Notwithſtanding thoſe who do now ſo greeuouſly perturbe our peace, did attempt the ſame euen in his dayes, but their endeuours being preuented by his prudence, tooke ſmall effect ſo long as he liued. But
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9135:26"/> alas, ſince his too timely death and departure, what miſerie hath found vs, and what trouble hath fallen vpon vs? God pardon the cauſers thereof, and grant vs perfect peace and brotherly charitie: <hi>Vt omnes cognoſcant quòd diſcipuli Christi ſimus.</hi> That all men may know vs to be the diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus good Syr, haue I laid downe vnto you the whole grounds of the crimes, wherof both my ſelfe and diuers others of our brethren are accuſed. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>referre the matter to your iudgement, to diſcerne whether we be guiltie of them or no. If you doubt of the truth of my relation, I deſire none other triall then the teſtimonie of mine accuſers; who if they denie any one word that I haue vttered by way of narration, I can eaſily procure ſuch proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as they ſhall not denie, vnleſſe they will denie themſelues. If my deductions, arguments, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, vſed in yeelding reaſon for our not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting M. <hi>Blackwells</hi> authoritie vpon the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Cardinall <hi>Caietaines</hi> Letters, and that for ſo doing, we incurred no note either of ſchiſme, or diſobedience to his holineſſe; if they I ſay need any proofe, I will vndertake to make them moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>Wherefore according to theſe grounds, I humbly beſeech you to paſſe your opinion, and yeeld your iudgement of our cauſe. And if the grounds prooue true, your iudgement conformable therevnto, may remaine firme: but if they prooue otherwiſe, your iudgement notwithſtanding ſhall not be faultie; for he that iudgeth according to his euidence, is not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9135:27"/> of any errour. This good Sir, I requeſt, becauſe I deſire to know your opinion of our cauſe, which if you giue according to theſe grounds, I ſhal eaſily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand whether you wil condemne or cleare mee &amp; my brethren of the crimes obiected; for I am ſure I haue not erred in declaring the ſtate of the matter.</p>
            <p>If this which I haue ſaid be not ſufficient for your full ſatisfaction; I hope it wil ſuffice at leaſt to ſuſpend your iudgement of vs, vntill further triall be had of our cauſe; which being had in any indifferent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and if we being conuicted, do not acknowledge our fault, and make competent ſatisfaction, then do not ſpare to account of vs as Heathens &amp; Publicans. But our aduerſaries purpoſe not to put the matter to any indifferent tryall, or to ende it by any equall meanes, but to decide it by ſtrong hand, might, and violence; by perpetuall oppreſſing vs with infamous ſlaunders of ſchiſme, faction, and the like; thereby to depriue, if it can be, our brethren abroad, of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient entertainment, and to debarre vs in priſon of neceſſary reliefe, to the ende that neceſſitie may compell vs to yeeld to their deſires: the inequalitie of which proceedings, I beſeech you with indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider. Sometime it is ſeen, that a partie wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to contend, is iuſtly compelled to admit an equall compremiſe, and to ſtand to the arbitrement of an indifferent Iudge: but it was neuer ſeene where iuſtice and conſcience ruled; and muche leſſe amongſt ſuch as ought to be the rule of other mens conſciences, that the partie willing to ſtand to anie indifferent tryall, ſhould bee compelled
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9135:27"/> by violence, to agree vnto the deſire of his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, how iuſt or vniuſt ſoeuer it be, and that without any further ſentence, but onely becauſe his aduerſary muſt haue his will.</p>
            <p>Good Sir, we are heere in this place, diuers in great want, in ſo much, that beſides our debts to the keeper, we haue not to defend vs from the iniury of the winter weather: whereof that you may haue ſome ſpecial taſte, I doo you to vnderſtand, that ſince Trinitie Terme, wee haue receiued no more from London, from whence the chiefeſt part of our reliefe commeth, then will ſuffice for three weekes charges with him that can husband his matters beſt. And this ſhalbe ſufficient to inſinuate vnto you our wants, hoping that as opportunitie ſerueth, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the relieuing thereof; confidently hoping withal, that God for whoſe cauſe we ſuffer, not onely of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon aduerſary, but alſo of thoſe who ought to be our friends, wil giue vs patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whatſoeuer croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes befal vs, to beare them to the end. For mine owne part, they may by their violent proceedings, make me yeeld my breath and life, which by Gods grace, I ſhall if need require, willingly ſacrifice for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of iuſtice, equitie, and mine owne innocencie: but my conſent to theſe vniuſt dealings, by Gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, they ſhall neuer extort out of me.</p>
            <p>If any one to whom you ſhall thinke good to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this (as I am not againſt the imparting it to any, ſo that you keepe the originall your ſelfe) ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to improue me of any vntruth: I will either ſatisfie his obiections euen to your own iudgement,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9135:28"/> or elſe I will acknowledge mine errour.</p>
            <p>Take this, good Sir, for a taſte of our internall and domeſticall troubles, wherewith I imagine you are not much acquainted, and therefore are you worſe affected to our cauſe: and as you ſhall giue me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after occaſion, you ſhall vnderſtand more; for this is but a ſmall thing in reſpect of that which this matter affordeth. But I feare I haue bene too tedious in this ſo diſguſtfull a diſcourſe; but let, I pray you, the hard tearmes my good name is brought into, plead my pardon for my tediouſneſſe, and the equitie of my Plea, procure me your fauour, and ſo in all humble ſort I take my leaue.</p>

               <p>SIr, if you do not conſider diligently the haynous<note place="margin">Poſt ſcriptu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> enormitie of ſchiſme impoſed vpon me, you will peraduenture condemne me of too much preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if not of contention, for labouring to defend my ſelfe from the note thereof; and will thinke that I ought rather to ſuffer ſome ſmall infamie, then by oppoſing my ſelfe ſo earneſtly, to repell the ſame, to procure a further breach between mine accuſers and my ſelfe, to both our harmes, and to the offence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But if you conſider firſt, to admit the infamy of this ſlaunder, (though it were of it ſelfe but ſmall) were in ſome ſort to giue occaſion to mine accuſers, to heape vpon my head greater wrongs hereafter,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9135:28"/> (for he that will offer wrong in one thing, will do the like in an other if occaſion ſerue) you ſhall finde it to be neither wiſedome nor pietie, to giue place to ſuch beginnings. Secondly, the condition of mine eſtate requiring a moſt entire fame, I ſhould both wrong my ſelfe, and ſlaunder my function, if I ſhould admit any blemiſh or blotte therein, which I may by mine owne endeuour wipe away: and therefore to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe peace at ſuch a price, I hold it not lawfull: for <hi>Non eſt faciendum malum vt eremat bonum.</hi> Euill is not to be done that good may enſue. And as S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith: <hi>Qui famam ſuam negligit, crudelis eſt.</hi> Hee that neglecteth his good name is cruell. But if third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the intrinſical enormitie of this crime, you will eaſily excuſe mine endeuour in clearing my ſelf therof, from all note of contention. For amongſt all other ſinnes againſt our neighbour, ſchiſme is the greateſt: and the pennalties which the Church hath alwaies inflicted on ſuch as haue bene guiltie therof, proue the ſame; to weet, excommunication and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from all vſe of Sacraments, as appeareth by diuers auncient Canons, &amp; alſo in <hi>Bulla caenae:</hi> which being graunted, neceſſarily followeth heynous ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, committed by the miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Sacraments, and the fruſtrating of all confeſſions made to all ſuch as they do terme ſchiſmatikes. For my fuller acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of which ſchiſme, in one word I ſay, that if I be a ſchiſmaticke, <hi>Clemens</hi> the eight is a ſchiſmaticke; for his wil is my wil, both in this and all other things pertaining to Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, and for mine obedience and ſubiection to him in the ſame,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9135:29"/> as hetherto by Gods grace I haue not, ſo God aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting me hereafter, I will not refuſe to yeeld my life, if at any time it be exacted.</p>
               <p>Peraduenture Sir you will maruell, how I dare at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſay thus much in mine own and my brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens defence, our Arch-prieſt hauing vnder paine of ſuſpenſion, commanded the contrary. But you may vnderſtand, that this commandement cannot bee of force (and therefore not to be reſpected) for diuers cauſes. And chiefly, for that the law of nature graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth abſolute freedome to euery one to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his goods either of fame or fortune, and to labour by lawfull meanes, to recouer them being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly taken from him. For which cauſe it is an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable errour, annullating any iuridicall ſentence to forbid a man to defend himſelfe. <hi>Silueſter verb. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. 2. num. 1. &amp;</hi> 16. Our Arch-prieſts prohibitory cenſures therefore in this caſe, are euen by the law of nature made void. And if he ſay that we haue ſuffred no wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g by the loſſe of our good names, but that we haue iuſtly deſerued the infamy of ſchiſme, it wil not ſerue his turn, for he being in this caſe, a party ſubiect to triall, and therfore no Iudge to diſcerne whether we haue ſuffered wrong or no, his ſentence or opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> herein can be of no more force, then his ought to be, who hauing taken away an other mans goods, ſaith that he hath not wronged him, and therfore forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him to proſecute the caſe againſt him, vnder paine of a greater diſpleaſure: for this is iuſt our caſe. I might ſay much more in this matter, but I haue bin too long already, and I hope this will ſuffice for this point: and ſo once againe I take my leaue.</p>

               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:9135:39"/> and them, what ground was, the not receiuing of Letters from them of thoſe conceits? If they will ſay that they muſt needs receiue all Letters which come to <hi>Rome</hi> directed to them, &amp; ſo ſoone as they do come to them, daily practiſe will conuince the contrarie, howſoeuer he ſhuffleth off this contradiction, that as yet no Letter appeared from M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> (as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> affirmeth in the firſt Paragraffe) and that he had that weeke receiued a ſtale Letter from him (as hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth in the ſecond Paragraffe) but it appeareth both in this former part of F. <hi>Parſons</hi> Letter, and alſo in all which followeth in the ſame, that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> thought it a great ſinne for himſelfe, not to deſerue blame. What errours were acknowledged at <hi>Rome,</hi> I know not, but it is very likely that they would haue bene ſpecified vpon ſo good an occaſion as was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to F. <hi>Parſons</hi> by M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and is by F. <hi>Parſons</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the 21.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9135:40"/> againe into a pit, out of which as yet he neuer came, ſince his firſt fall into it. Thoſe commendations of himſelfe, which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> tooke no great diſguſt to repeate, (meaning that theſe Letters ſhould paſſe farre and neare, as appeareth in the 6. Paragraffe) were vſed by M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> perchance to trie if by fitting ſo well F. <hi>Parſons</hi> humour, he might draw him to that which as it ſhould ſeeme by M. <hi>Biſhops</hi> reply, was not in him. What M. Doctor <hi>Cic.</hi> did write of others complaints I know not; but ſo farre as without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence I may, I thinke that it was a moſt lamentable caſe, that two Prieſts comming as it became Prieſts, towards <hi>Rome,</hi> to deale with his holineſſe about ſuch things as belonged to the Church, and were ſaid to be done by his order, not confirmed by any Letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the See Apoſtolique, or any other ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhould be iudged to be laide in priſon with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy (as is before ſhewed out of F. <hi>Parſons</hi> Letters) after many yeares ſpent by the ſame two Prieſts in their Countrey, many daungers of loſſe of libertie, and life ouerpaſſed in defence of the Catholique Church, and particularly of the dignitie of the See Apoſtolique, and a glorious confeſſion of the one in priſon, and baniſhment of the ſame.</p>
            <p>To omit the reſt of their entertainment at <hi>Rome,</hi> I cannot but maruel that there ſhould be ſo grieuous a ſentence of baniſhment, and confinement giuen againſt them, who offered at their arraignement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the two Cardinalls (the ſentence deſerueth that tearme) to anſwere to what was obiected, and they who put vp the Libell (that is a bill of complaints
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9135:40"/> and accuſation) againſt them (when they perceiued how readie they were to make their anſwere) reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on their knees of the Iudges, that the Libell might not be deliuered vnto them, but rather that all things ſhould be peaceably ended; to which the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges enclined, and therevpon deliuered not the Libel to the two Prieſts, who had demaunded it, to make their anſwere vnto it.</p>
            <p>All things at that time paſſed in ſuch ſort, as they ſhould haue bin preſently ſet at liberty, had not there bin a deliberation to ſtaie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for two or three dayes (as was then prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by their aduerſaries) in regard that M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> behaued himſelf with more confidence and boldneſſe in this cauſe, then was to ſome of their likings. Which I note the more at large, in regard of an vngodly Letter pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> or at the leaſt by his inſtructions, as it is moſt plaine by ſome of the particulars; at the handling wherof, M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> was not preſent, although it goeth masked vnder M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> his name to his friend, bearing date the 20. of Februarie, 1599. Wherein he vndertaketh as a Proctor in the Arch-prieſts caſe againſt theſe two Prieſts, to relate the ſtorie of that which paſſed vpon the ſeuenteenth of the ſame moneth, at their triall: and among many moſt ſhameleſſe vntruthes, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the two Prieſts (whom in ſcorne he calleth Embaſſadors) were able to ſay litle to that which he and M. Doctor <hi>Haddock</hi> had libelled againſt them; and were willing to ſay leſſe, but onely excuſed their owne intentions, and asked pardon, if they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſcandall by their manner of proceeding, more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9135:41"/> then euer they meant. Whereas the onely pretence that was made, why they were not at the ſame time ſet at libertie, was more courage then was well liked of in pleading for themſelues, &amp; confident demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the Libell to anſwere vnto it. Before or after which time, they neuer were brought before the Iudges, &amp; yet a ſentence of baniſhment, and confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any prouiſion made for them, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt them: and what coniectures was made of this by ſuch as heard thereof, I know not; neither hath F. <hi>Parſons</hi> as it ſhould ſeeme by theſe his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, any further knowledge what M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> report, but a heareſay from a heareſay, a ſlender ground to publiſh in ſuch ſort as he doth againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although not in print, yet with ſo many Copies, as they are common inough, and are carried about to ſuch as are thought will not beſtowe the paines to write out Father <hi>Parſons</hi> follies, or the coſt otherwiſe to haue them: and thus much for the 3. and 4.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9135:41"/> which he maketh to caſt off all the blame of the hard meaſure which was meated to the two Prieſts, and the ſhuffling of the ſame from himſelfe, vpon the Pope, in the 7. 8. and 10. Paragraffe, although in this 5. Paragraffe hee would moſt holilie perſwade, that, had not theſe things touched his holineſſe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by falſe and iniurious reports, againſt all truth and equitie, hee could and would haue diſpenſed with whatſoeuer touched himſelfe.

            <p>F. <hi>Parſons</hi> neither made anie friendly offer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the two Prieſts in the Colledge for the daies of hoſpitallitie accuſtomed, as hee affirmeth in the 7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Paragraffe, nor ſuffered them to remaine there, but when they demanded it, he denied it, vpon the cauſe which here he alledgeth: to which, reply was made, that, what other buſineſſe ſoeuer they had, they had alſo that cauſe of comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might lawfully demaund ſuch entertainment. And after foure or fiue daies, that they had wroong themſelues in, he found a meanes to thruſt them out againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the accuſtomed daies of hoſpitallitie were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, charging them, that they did by murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope, giue euil edification, which for lacke of better proofe, F. <hi>Owen</hi> a Ieſuite, and F. <hi>Parſons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in that buſineſſe, would demonſtrate vnto
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9135:42"/> them, becauſe that one of them being demaunded whether that they had ſeene ſuch a man in England, anſwered, that he had ſeene him, but not talked with him, yet vnderſtood that he was hardly dealt withall, becauſe ſuch as were accuſtomed to entertain Prieſts at their firſt comming, were perſwaded by ſome, that they ſhould not giue him any entertainment, and that his neareſt of kinne were told, that in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience they could not receiue him. If F. <hi>Parſons</hi> charitie and his fellowes toward the two Prieſtes, or the third of whom they ſpake, had bene anſwerable to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, this would neuer haue bene ſo iudged of by them, and ſo vehemently maintained to haue bene a murmure againſt the Pope, vnleſſe for the Popes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honour, they will as vnaduiſedly laie this to his charge, that it was his wil the Prieſt ſhould be thus v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as in this ſame 7. Paragraffe F. <hi>Parſons</hi> (forgetting that his motiue to write this Letter, was to deliuer the Pope from falſe and iniurious reports) boldly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that his holineſſe hauing bene enformed by his <hi>Nuntios</hi> in <hi>Fraunce</hi> &amp; <hi>Flaunders,</hi> of the comming of the two Prieſts, was ſo much offended therewith, that he ment to put them in priſon. What truth there is in this report I cannot ſay, or what falſhood; ſure I am, that it ſoundeth like a verie iniurious report a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope, if he had ſuch a meaning; and much more, if he had it not, as in reaſon we ſhould thinke he had not; for who can in reaſon thinke, that his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe onely vpon newes of the comming of two Prieſts to him with ſo great aduenture, and daunger of life, about matters of the Church, would deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9135:42"/> to put them in priſon before hee heard them what they had to ſay, or ſawe them? But to auoide his holineſſe of blame, we wil ſupply in this place for F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> that if the <hi>Nuntios</hi> did ſignifie any ſuch matter vnto his holineſſe, as moſt likely they did not, they did ſende ſuche informations againſt the two Prieſtes, as the Pope might purpoſe to caſt them in priſon ſo ſoone as they came to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and then let vs demaund where theſe Informers had their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and of whom? of themſelues they could not, being farre aſunder each from other, and both out of England, whence the two Prieſts came. If of any other, who were they? or were they ſuch parties (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though religious of the ſocietie, who onely can be imagined to haue correſpondence with them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be vnlikely, eſpecially with him in <hi>France</hi>) that vpon their bare accuſations the <hi>Nuntios</hi> would write to ſuch purpoſe to his holineſſe, as hee ſhould determine vpon this relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Nuntios,</hi> to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſoone as they ſhuld come to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing, or hauing any further proofe of the accuſations made againſt them by their aduerſaries? Yet is not this report more iniurious againſt the Pope, whom he vndertaketh in the 5. Paragraffe to deliuer from al falſe, and iniurious reports, againſt all truth &amp; equitie, then his proofe is inſufficient which here he maketh in defence of himſelfe; for which in the 5. Paragraffe he ſeemed that he would wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon his knowne deeds, not vpon his writing, his proofe is, that F. <hi>Bellarmino</hi> now Cardinall was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his Holi. to write to <hi>Rome,</hi> to know F. <hi>Parſons</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:9135:43"/> opinion of the two Prieſts, therefore F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had not enformed againſt them.

Doth the Popes commaundement to F. <hi>Bellarmino</hi> to write to F. <hi>Parſons</hi> to know his opinion of the two Prieſts, proue, that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had not ſent information againſt them? Or if it be true, that the Pope did giue this commaundement to F. <hi>Bellarmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> doth it conuince that what perſwaſions F. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino</hi> vſed to the Pope, or ſome other (if hee would not be ſeene in it) did not proceed from F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> who, had hee not beneſtaied by this Letter of F. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmino,</hi> would haue come to <hi>Ferrara</hi> himſelfe, as it ſhould ſeeme by the ſame Letter? If the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons giuen to the Pope againſt theſe two Prieſts, by reaſon whereof they were to be impriſoned (for no man but F. <hi>Parſons</hi> as I thinke, would ſay, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any informations againſt them, his holines vpon
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9135:43"/> a bare heareſay that they were comming to him to deale in matters of the Church, would reſolue to put them in priſon) muſt of neceſſitie bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as comming from F. <hi>Parſons.</hi> How is it true, that his holineſſe reſolued to put them in priſon, before he had F. <hi>Parſons</hi> opinion of them?

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> In the 8. Paragraffe I woonder howe Father <hi>Parſons</hi> can ſay, that the Ieſuites eſpecially had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for many yeares, that there ſhould be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination among the Prieſts, to deliuer themſelues from all ſhewe of that calumniation vſed to be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that they would gouerne the Prieſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills; when as by credible report, F. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> (without whom no Engliſh Ieſuite durſt do any thing) laboured mightily againſt it, vntil he ſaw that the ſecular Prieſts went ſeriouſly about it: and it is ſo euident, that no man may without ouermuch impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9135:44"/> denie it; that all the ſtrife, which was openly in England betweene the Ieſuites, and the Prieſts, began vpon occaſion of a gouernment, which the Ieſuites ſought, &amp; would haue had ouer the Prieſts, who were in durance at <hi>Wisbitch</hi> againſt many their wills; and for the better effecting of that, to which moſt inordinately they aſpired, they did not onely endeuour to diſgrace them, as men that were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of libertie, but were the occaſion alſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Catholiques did ſend them no reliefe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond vntruth in this 8. Paragraffe is, that the man or authoritie was admitted, and appointed moſt willingly by all the body, both of Prieſts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholiques in England, and abroad alſo. For F. <hi>Parſons</hi> confeſſed himſelfe at <hi>Rome</hi> to the Prieſts, (who were ſent thither) that he himſelfe appointed the man, leaſt ſome ſuch other ſhould haue bin cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the generall, and free ſuffrages of the Prieſts, as would not runne along with the Ieſuites: and as for the authoritie, I thinke I may boldly ſay, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſt, nor Clarke in England, euer dreamed of the authoritie of an Arch-prieſt; whoſe office is cleane out of vſe now in England, except the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining part thereof; neither can it be ſaid that euer it was willingly approued by the Prieſts: who for the moſt part, had their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſents wroong fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them by the Ieſuites, &amp; the Archprieſt himſelf; &amp; if there were no other proofe of the prieſts not free approouing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as they are many) the qualitie of his authoritie, as it was firſt graunted (at what time the Prieſts were ſent to <hi>Rome</hi>) will ſhewe it manifeſtly, or iuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9135:44"/> thoſe, who approued it of great haſte, for without any authoritie to do them the leaſt good, or repaire the leaſt harme he might do to them, he had a bare office of a lawleſſe executioner, of which the Prieſts in England ſtood in no need.</p>
            <p>The 3. vntruth in this Paragraffe is, that it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at <hi>Rome</hi> by the accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the two Prieſts, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few oppoſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, for they brought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficient teſtimony, that many oppoſed themſelues: that is, were very much diſcontented with it, and thought what would come of it, although the two Prieſts who went to <hi>Rome,</hi> had parſonally talked but with fewe, and therfore could not iuſtifie vpon their oathes for many.</p>
            <p>The fourth vntruth in this Paragraffe is, that they brought no matter of ſubſtance againſt his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whereas F. <hi>Parſons</hi> could not but know very well, that the ſtrife being betweene the Ieſuites, and the Prieſts, he who ſhould be at the Ieſuites deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, could be no fit gouernour ouer the Prieſts, and when F. <hi>Parſons</hi> writ theſe Letters of his, he could not bee ignorant both that the Arch-prieſt had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to be in ſome ſort ordered by them, and he profeſſed it openly, that no ſecular Prieſt muſt be of his counſell in this his gouernment of ſecular Prieſts, who ſhould diſlike any thing in the Ieſuites; which was depoſed, and in particular iuſtified at <hi>Rome:</hi> beſide this, if F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſay true in the 17. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe, the Arch-prieſt was touched in the very mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his faith; for that an hereticall propoſition was laid to his charge, as appeared by their papers, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9135:45"/> depoſitions yet extant. Laſtly, if it ſhould be proued that the Arch-prieſt conſulted about the ſuſpending of ſome, with certaine Ieſuites onely and ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, this gouernment of the ſecular Prieſts would proue little commendable.</p>
            <p>The 5. vntruth is, that they cauſed a moſt peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſchiſme, &amp; ſedition among Catholiques, by this their ſubſtracting themſelues from this obedience. Is it to cauſe a ſchiſme, not to obey him, whom vnder their oathes (if it be true which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſaith in the 17. Paragraffe) they touched in the very matter of his faith? but whether this were ſo or no, I am not here to diſcourſe. Could they be accuſed of ſchiſme, which formerly includeth a voluntary, actuall, or vertuall diuiſion from the heade, with like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the head; who ſent directly to the head to vnderſtand whether that did come from the head, which was pretended to come from him, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged without any his Letters, or any teſtimonie ſufficient to binde them? or were the Engliſh Prieſts, who haue ſo well deſerued of Gods Church, to be ſo ſeuerely cenſured for doing that which is lawfull in all places; that is, to oppoſe againſt any preferred, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially without their knowledge and conſent, by their aduerſaries, before that he be confirmed in his authoritie? promiſing in the meane time as they did, to diſcharge themſelues as became them, and to obeye in what they might knowe themſelues bound.</p>
            <p>The 6. vntruth is, that the Pope foreſawe all that which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> rehearſeth in this 8. Paragraffe;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9135:45"/> which being falſe, might vpon wrong information be beleeued, but not be foreſeene.</p>
            <p>The 7. vntruth is, that the Pope did heare all that the two Prieſts brought; of whom did his holineſſe heare it? they were neuer ſuffered to be heard by his holineſſe, as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth in the 13. Paragraffe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> In the 9. Paragraffe F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſheweth how hee dealt with the two Prieſts to return againe with their credites, by ending forſooth all matters at the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Generall of the Ieſuites, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor (who was allied to him) both vnequall Arbiters in a difficultie raiſed by the Ieſuits againſt the Prieſts; yet, as it ſhould appeare, they were not ſo backward to deale with the Protector concerning the new au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ſent into England by him onely (for anie thing that they knew, or could ſufficiently learne) for ſo ſoone as they vnderſtood of his arriuall at <hi>Rome,</hi> and could come to him, which was vpon the 21. of December, they brake the matter vnto him, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting him that he would liſten to the iuſt petitions of many well deſeruing of the Catholique Church, which if he ſhould doo, they would not trouble his holineſſe with this matter; and hee willed them to bring in writing what they had to ſay, promiſing them, that he would conſider thereon; to which the two Prieſts accorded, and departed, intending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne ſo ſoone as the holy-daies would licenſe them to follow their buſineſſe, and they might haue free acceſſe to the Cardinall: but vpon the 29. day, which was wont to be in great reuefence among all Engliſh
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9135:46"/> Catholiques, that is to ſay, vpon the feaſt of S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> they were apprehended with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie; as Father <hi>Parſons</hi> confeſſeth in the 10. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe (and ſooner perchance ſhould haue bene, had not <hi>Tiber</hi> by a ſtraunge invndation kept their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries aſunder) depriued of all their writings, perfect and vnperfect, and neuer after ſuffered to deale toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning their buſineſſe which they had in hand, vntill the 3. or 4. day after that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had procured (God knoweth out of what Office) an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical briefe, in conformation of the Arch-prieſt his authoritie; yet all this muſt be cloaked with the loue of vnion, and reſpect with due obedience to the ſuperiours ordination, &amp; vnder this colour he, M.

He might haue put downe this alſo for him ſelfe, for he was their auncient likewiſe in both; but if all the time which they three ſpent in Englande were put together, it woulde hardly make out the time which hee that trauelled leaſt in England of theſe two, had ſpent, for all three ranne away, and not all of them in ſo good ſort, as ſome wiſhed they had, being ſo haſtie to be gone.</p>
            <p>Concerning the laſt clauſe of the 9. Paragraffe, I knowe not how many names of Prieſts F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſhewed them, or whether hee ſhewed them any or no, but I do verily thinke he might haue ſhewed the names of many more, then hee could iuſtifie their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9135:46"/> conſents vnto it, their names being knowne heere in England to haue bene wroong from them by the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, and the Arch-prieſt in his owne behalfe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it to be expected of the two Prieſts to name vnder their oathes any great company, not hauing ſpecially ſpoken with many, yet they brought teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, that many diſliked it, of which perchaunce ſome in particular, who had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them their names, had for feare afterward ſubſcribed in the behalfe of the Arch-prieſt of which kind the more names were ſhewed, the leſſe was the number of thoſe who <hi>Fa.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> In the 10. Paragraffe, F. <hi>Parſons</hi> beginneth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge his choler againſt the two Prieſts for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie, becauſe forſooth they would not deſiſt from their purpoſe, and follow his humour. Secondly, he ioyneth an vntruth, if the Protector and they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in ſuch order, as is ſet downe in the 9. paragraffe, or the Cardinall <hi>Burgheſe</hi> promiſed them all the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance hee could giue them in their matters, as I am credibly informed he did. Thirdly, it is not likely that the two Cardinalls (not knowing what was to be ſaide) would vpon a bare ſuſpition charge them with an enterpriſe of contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation at all, vnleſſe F. <hi>Parſons</hi> will ſay, that they had ſuch a foreſight, as hee attributeth to the Pope in the 8. paragraffe; or that hee had plotted ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as wherein could be no errour, or the leaſt cauſe of exception either againſt the authoritie, or Officers, for how elſe (before men were heard)
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9135:47"/> could there be ſuch a iudgement in ſuch as were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed wiſe men, and thought fit to be pillers of Gods Church? What foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was for them to build vpon, I will leaue to a more Clearklike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, &amp; for a fewe complements ſake, briefly note ſome points of many, which I haue ſeene, to ſhewe how lightly F. <hi>Parſons</hi> laieth his foundation vpon he knew not what, for the iuſtifying of himſelfe in that action, and what was done by his meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt for a foundation is noted, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall did ſhewe in the ſelfe-ſame Letters wherein he made M. <hi>Black.</hi> an Arch-prieſt, and gaue him his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that the motiue hereof, was a moſt falſe, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ignominious ſuggeſtion made to the Pope againſt the Seminary Prieſts, and the Catholiques, and therefore the thing therevpon graunted meerly voide.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Cardinall affirmeth onely in the ſame Letters, that he had commaundement from his holineſſe to vnite together theſe Prieſts, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, which were at that falſe ſuggeſted variance, and therefore when that vnion was made he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his office, and by this Commiſſion had no more to do; if then this vnitie wil be ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to haue bene betweene the Prieſts, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, before this authoritie was giuen in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, this authoritie was voide.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Cardinall being no Biſhop at all, much leſſe ouer all <hi>England</hi> (and <hi>Scotland</hi> where was a Catholique Arch-biſhop) nor ſhewing any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, by which he could make an Arch-prieſt ouer all
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9135:47"/> the Engliſh Prieſts reſiding in <hi>England</hi> (and <hi>Scotland</hi>) had litle reaſon to looke that the appointment of this authoritie by him, ſhould be taken without mouing any queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it was ſo ſtraunge a thing, that one Prieſt ſhould haue ſo ample an authoritie ouer all the reſt of his fellow Prieſts, as they might iuſtly aske how it came to paſſe, and ſhew what inconuenience they knew was likely to enſue thereon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, the Cardinall being deligated to make this peace, was not to vſe al means that he could, or ſhuld ſeeme conuenient vnto him, or beſt for his purpoſe; but onely ſuch as without which ſuch a peace could not be wrought; as the chiefeſt and perchance all writers vpon this matter doo generally affirme, and ſo interpret that which is ſaid of a delegatiue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that it is <hi>ſtricti Iuris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly it is euident, that thoſe who were ſaid to haue dealt with his holineſſe about this matter, were not of the ſecular Prieſts in England, but Ieſuites ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profeſſed, or vowed, or at leaſt ſuch as had giuen their names to be Ieſuites; for in this action F. <hi>Parſons</hi> was the principall, and M. F. <hi>Iones</hi> ſtand the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who being in a ſecular Prieſts habit, deluded the Pope, and pleaded as ſent by the Prieſts in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or with their conſent; of which afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chalenged for his audacious attempt, he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before many Prieſts, he did but preſume.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seuenthly, the authoritie was meerly an afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue authoritie, to puniſh the Prieſtes without any power to repaire the harme it might do to them, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9135:48"/> to puniſh them extreamely, as by taking away their faculties, and ſuſpending them from the Altar; by which offices they liue, and not by any benifices, which remaine to Prieſts in other Countries after ſuch proceedings, and in the hardeſt dealing they haue ſomewhat allowed them for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and now leaſt that ſome being thus debarred from vſe of their function, ſhould in reſpect of their preaching receiue ſome charitie from Catholiques, they are forbidden by the Arch-prieſt to preach.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The ſuggeſtions being made (as appeareth by the Cardinalls Letters) that a ſtrife was betweene prieſts, and Catholiques; this authoritie ouer the one part, onely ſeemed a very friuolous thing, for in the Cardinalls Letter, there is no authoritie giuen but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Prieſts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, the Arch-prieſt by this authoritie giuen vnto him, might vnder a colour of hauing more good done elſe-where, remoue any Prieſt out of any houſe ſoeuer, and thereby endanger both the Prieſts by driuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch new acquaintance, as ſhould be readie vpon euery ſurmiſe of trouble, turne them going to goe ſeeke aduentures; and alſo the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, by thruſting vpon them as often as he liſt ſuch as he had deſire to preferre; or to compell them to keepe no Prieſts in their houſes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Whereas the Arch-prieſt was appointed by the Cardinalls Letter to chooſe his aſſiſtants among the auncienteſt of thoſe who had their abiding neare vnto him, where at that time he was to aduiſe with them in his proceedings; he contrary to this, made
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9135:48"/> his choiſe of ſuch as might ſerue him in place rather of Promooters, or Informers, what was done in farre parts, then in place of Councellors, &amp; were ſildome or neuer made priuie to his actions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> In the chooſing alſo of theſe his Councellors to aſſiſt him in this his gouernment, I am not heere to touch his partiallitie, further then this, as he ſaid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the diſlike in any man of any matter in the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, was a ſufficient let for him to be a Councellor, or an aſſiſtant.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> The controuerſies which were in England, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betweene the Ieſuites and the Prieſts, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt in his inſtructions annected to his commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was willed to aduiſe with the ſuperiour of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, and to followe his counſell in this his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prieſts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> The Arch-prieſt had no authoritie at all ouer the Ieſuites, betwixt whom and the Prieſts were all the controuerſies which were in England, and therefore his authoritie was no fit meane to make a peace in England, where really there was need.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> When the Arch-prieſt propoſed or made knowne to the Prieſts what authoritie was giuen vnto him, he vſed ſo litle truth therein, as ſhould an other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the faith of Chriſt in that ſort, and ſhould bee hanged for his labour, he would prooue but a fooliſh Martyr; and howſoeuer the matter is now ſlubbered ouer, it was at that time ſo manifeſt, as there was no ſhift for it, but open confeſſion to M. <hi>Col.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Either the Arch-prieſt himſelf did knowe what

If hee did, the Prieſts had the greater reaſon to ſuſpect euil dealing, by his affirming at the firſt, that he had ſuch and ſuch authoritie, and not long after denied it, and ſmall (God wot) is the ſatisfaction which is giuen for this, that forſoothe he might ſay, that he had ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, becauſe he could write to thoſe who had it.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> If it ſhould be true which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſaith in the 17.

            <p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Before any Apoſtolicall Breue appeared for the confirmation of this authoritie, it was ſuſpected that it was not the Popes order, yea and afterward proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if the Popes Commiſſary imployed by his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at <hi>Rome</hi> in this matter be an honeſt man, for he told the two Prieſts who were ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> ſeuerally in their perſons from the Popes owne mouth, that his holineſſe did not appoint it, and gaue this reaſon from his holineſſe, becauſe he would not aduenture to haue his authoritie contemned in England by the Prieſts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> To conclude, if before the Breue was made the authoritie might without offence haue bene ſaid not to haue bene of the Popes appointing; what offence was it not to accept of it?

            <p>Let vs now returne to F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> who (forgetting himſelfe what hee had promiſed in the 5.

For in this paragraffe it is ſet downe, that after 17. dayes of the two Prieſtes perſiſting in their obſtinacie (which was no other then is ſhewed in the 9. paragraffe) his holineſſe willed them to be retired to ſome place of cuſtodie in reſpect of their offence, and their allegations to be there examined, whether they were worth the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling or no. Which comming to F. <hi>Parſon</hi> his knowledge, hee intreated that their retirement might rather be with ſecrecie in the Engliſh Colledge, then with more infamie in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other place. So that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> heere laieth to the Popes charge, that hee cauſed the two Prieſts firſt to be impriſoned for their offence, and afterward to haue it tried, whether they had committed any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; for if it had ſo fallen out, that their allegations had bene worth the handling, what offence had they committed in comming to <hi>Rome</hi> to deale with his

But the Pope foreſawe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance (as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſaith) in the 8. paragraffe, that they were not worth the handling.

But perchance it was no certaine foreſight, ſuch as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> noteth in the 8. paragraffe; but only a ſuſpition as he affirmeth in the 10. paragraffe. Then was this no iuſt cauſe to vſe two Prieſts with infamy, who had many yeares aduentured their liues in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Popes honour, and dignitie of the Sea Apoſtolicke. But afterward perchance it ſo fell out, that their allegations were founde not to be woorth the handling. Let vs ſuppoſe that which was not, that they were permitted to deale together or with other, and could bring nothing worth the handling. What then? ſhall we to ſaue the Pope from falſe and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reports (as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> pretendeth) ſay, that the Pope was ignorant of this ſaying, hee who loueth daunger ſhall periſh in it; and like ſychophants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that his holineſſe may do what he will before he ſee or know any cauſe why hee ſhould doo it, and really defame them againſt whom he hath nothing, but an imagination, that it might be they deſerued it? had they bene impriſoned vpon colour of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be laide againſt them, ſomewhat in this kind might haue bin iuſtified; but comming as plaintiffes, ſupplicants, or appellants, they were to be heard, or at leaſt to be ſuffered to deale together in their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and for F. <hi>Parſons</hi> to pretend that two Prieſts comming to his Holineſſe (as in dutie they were bound to do in any difficulties of the Church) were
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9135:51"/> caſt with infamy into priſon, before they were heard what they had to ſay, &amp; that they ſhould haue bene caſt in priſon with more infamie (had not F. <hi>Parſons</hi> intreated for them) is not to pretermit that which concerneth himſelfe, and to ſtop iniurious reports gainſt the Pope (as he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in the 5. paragraffe) but to heape falſe and iniurious reports againſt the Pope, and to fall into moſt abſurd praiſe of himſelfe. And if F. <hi>Parſons</hi> did tell them, what benifites he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them, when they were with him, I dare preſume that they would not be ſo vngratefull as not to giue him thankes for them, although perchance not ſo greatly from their hearts, as if he had let them alone. Before they departed out of England, or were knowne who they were that ſhould goe, the ſpeech was rife in ſome mens mouthes, that they ſhould be caſt in priſon when they came to <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that F. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> wit was not ſo highly to be commended, in that he could foreſee, what thankes he was like to haue. Firſt for their impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Colledge. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for giuing them the beſt Chambers in the houſe with ſuch conditions. Thirdly, cheriſhing them gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis (that is, at the charge of the Colledge). Fourthly, viſiting them often (eſpecially at the firſt, for he muſt needs be the Commiſſioner to examine them). Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, making them good new gownes for the winter, (no doubt better then they had any, who had none at all) and with as much ſpeed as after long ſeeking for cloath for the purpoſe they could be made, and they were not ordinary good gownes for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for as they were not too hotte for the ſommer, ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9135:51"/> they were not too heauie for the winter: and as I make no queſtion, but that he deſerued thankes for his good will in this, ſo I doubt not, but that they gaue him thankes for them. Sixtly, giuing them a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a Notary gratis (for nought) who at the Commiſſary his appointment (that was F. <hi>Parſons</hi>) might write what he would haue written, and blotte out what he would haue blotted, if it did not fadge to his minde. Seuenthly, procuring the Iudge to come to the Colledge, &amp;c. Which, if F. <hi>Parſons</hi> did examine them himſelfe, poſſibly was very ſildome, and that only for a faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If F. <hi>Parſons</hi> 1. were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the means &amp; aſſiſtants of his aduerſaries, 2. caried to their owne houſe, 3. locked vp, and kept ſure inough fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaking with any body but at their diſcretion, 4. examined by them, &amp; his examination alſo taken as it ſhould pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A good new cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a good new ſommer gowne for the winter, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis cheriſhing, the ſauing of him from ſpending his money and taking many iournies about the ſtreets, could not (as I ſuppoſe) ſo dull theſe his aduerſaries wits, but that they might eaſily foreſee, how many more thanks they were like to haue for their labour, after that they had once made a friendly parting. Perchance F. <hi>Parſons</hi> expected ſuch an after applauſe as ſome Prieſts did make in England for their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who had authoritie to chaſtiſe them onely, and at his pleaſure, in moſt grieuous ſort.</p>

Secondly, they might haue ſaid what they would at any time, as well as at their examination, for their tongus were at libertie inough, had time and place bene conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for it; which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> was often told, when hee tooke vpon him to be a ſtickler in the matter, and would know what they could ſay; and if that they were willed vpon their oathes to ſpeake and anſwere to ſuch queſtions as might be asked, it doth not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that they did ſay all that they could, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they were perchance releaſed of their oath (take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Commiſſary appointed by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe) vpon ſome conſideration, for example, that they did accept of F. <hi>Parſons</hi> to be their examiner, who thruſt himſelfe into that office, and was ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he would abuſe it, as in truth he did; or elſe becauſe they perceiued that all was not written which they ſaid, nor that which was ſo written, ſo faithfully written, as they deliuered it, a Ieſuite being the examiner (who was a partie) and giuing them an other Ieſuit to be the Notarie, as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the 10. Paragraffe; which being all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany which were preſent, might and did deale, as pleaſed them; not onely with the two Prieſts, whoſe Iaylors they were, but with their examinations alſo, which they tooke. 3. They might alſo ſweare that they had no more to ſay of moment in all matters handled; not becauſe they could ſay no more, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſawe that they might hurt themſelues
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9135:52"/> (being at their aduerſaries deuotions) but were not likely to do any good in the cauſe which they had to handle. 4. They might ſweare they had nothing to ſay, becauſe neither of them had any commiſſion, or was ſent to deale in any thing ſeuerally, but ioyntly, and each with others helpe, which they could not doo (beeing kept cloſe priſoners, and ſo as one might not come to the other). If the Iudge of whom F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſpeaketh (who was no other then the Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or Commiſſarie afore mentioned) and the two Cardinalls came to the Colledge one day to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, (as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> heere ſaith) to the end, that they might be ſure of all, and ſatisfie both themſelues and the two Prieſts, they might haue done well to haue examined them, which they did not, but onely heard firſt ſome part of M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> his examination; who preſently after without any queſtion asked him (more then whether he would adde any thing to his examination) was ſhut vp as before. Then M. <hi>Ch.</hi> was called for, and ſome part of his examination read, after which being licenſed to ſpeake, he vſed ſome words to the ſo great liking of the two Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, that had it not bene for company-ſake, he had bene ſet at libertie the ſame day (as both M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and hee were told by the Ieſuites afterward) for as they pretended, the Cardinalls did not take well M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> his anſwere, that he had nothing to ſay, when he was licenſed after his examination was read, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commaunded him to cloſe priſon, and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> alſo for company; and they thought that they did not M. <hi>Ch.</hi> any iniury by making him a cloſe priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9135:53"/> againe, becauſe M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> his ſilence diſpleaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once, and his earneſtneſſe at an other time. After that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> and F. <hi>Titch.</hi> a couple of Ieſuites, the one the Examiner, the other the Notarie, &amp; were all the company that was preſent at this arraignment with the two Cardinalls, except M. <hi>Acryſio</hi> (who came thither as if he had before ſupplied the place of an Examiner) had read what they thought good, and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> diſmiſſed for a time into an outer-chamber, where the Cardinalls Retinew was, and ſome Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites was. F. <hi>Parſons</hi> called at the doore to F. <hi>Owin</hi> a Ieſuite (who during this time was vice-iaylor in F. <hi>Parſons</hi> place) to bring forth M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Proctors for the Arch-prieſt. F. <hi>Owin</hi> fetched M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> to M. <hi>Ch.</hi> who had not met for the ſpace of ſeuen weekes (in which time they had bene kept cloſe priſoners) and after they had imbraced each other, they went in together before the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, with M. Doctor <hi>Haddocke,</hi> &amp; M. <hi>Martin Array.</hi> The two Proctors who (after notice giuen vnto the Cardinalls by F. <hi>Parſons</hi> what they were, as though the Cardinalls had knowne neither the men, nor the office they then had) at their Qu. (as it ſhould ſeeme) deliuered vp in a dumbe ſhewe, a Libell or Bill of complaints and accuſations, againſt M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> without any words (whatſoeuer M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> ſaith, or F. <hi>Parſons</hi> vnder M. <hi>Martins</hi> name in his Letters, dated the 20. of February, 1599.) ſtuffed too ſhamefully with vntruthes. Among which, rehearſall is made of many ſpeeches, which are ſaid to haue bene vttered by M. <hi>Martin</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:9135:53"/> and his fellow Proctor before they exhibited their libel, as (to vſe their own words) being bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeak as Proctors, whereas in truth neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpake any one word good or bad, either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or as bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by any other. The libel being read by F. <hi>Titch.</hi> the Ieſuite, M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> was very earneſt to haue the Proctors put to their oathes, that no falſhood was conteined in the Libell, to which the Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> made anſwere that they were not to ſweare, but to prooue what ſhould be denied; then was the whole Libell denied, and a copie thereof demaunded, that anſwer might be made vnto it; but when the Proctors ſawe the reſolution of the two Prieſts, they humbly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with knee on ground, that no copie ſhould be deliuered, but that all things ſhould be ſhut vp in peace; to which the Cardinal <hi>Caietan</hi> made anſwere, that it was peace, which the two Prieſts ſought for, and preſently the two Proctors hauing readily what, and againſt whom to obiect, wrangled a little with the two Prieſts, and particularly M. <hi>Martin Array</hi> vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt M. <hi>Ch.</hi> that, and no other thing, namely that they intended to haue the Protector chaunged, which in the aforeſaid Letter of the 20. of February, hee (or F. <hi>Parſons</hi> rather vnder his name) affirmeth, that becauſe the Cardinall was preſent and ſatte as Iudge, they would not vrge for verie ſhame of their Engliſh ingratitude. After this litle wrangling confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Proctors were diſmiſſed, and the two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls calling M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> nearer vnto them, declared that they found no cauſe againſt them, only this they thought in their conſcience, that theſe two
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9135:54"/> Prieſts had vnaduiſedly taken this iourney, becauſe thereby they had ſcandalized many in England; to which the Prieſts made this anſwere, that if they had giuen any ſcandall they were ſorrie, &amp; readie to giue ſatisfaction, which M. <hi>Martin</hi> in the aforeſaid Letters doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme, but that he putteth it in a wrong place, for he putteth it, as if it had bene ſaid by the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors (as he termeth them) after they had heard his, and his fellowes falſly vaunted of obiections before they gaue vp the Libell, and the Libell it ſelfe, which was read againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, againſt which, ſaith M. <hi>Martin,</hi> or F. <hi>Parſons</hi> vnder his name, (among other his moſt ſhameleſſe vntruthes) they were able to ſay litle, and willing to ſay leſſe, but asked pardon if they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſcandall, &amp;c. If theſe men could haue perſwaded themſelues that neither M. D. <hi>Biſh.</hi> nor M. <hi>Ch.</hi> ſhould euer haue ſeene theſe Letters, or haue come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll theſe ſhameleſſe vntruthes, and wicked detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeeches, where they were ſo boldly ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, yet had they remembred there had bene a God, they would haue had ſome feare, if no reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto him, but theſe be thoſe of braſſe, who put themſelues forth as a wall for the houſe of the Lorde (of a flie) and would be accounted conſtant, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yea and friendly (as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> vrgeth in the 18. paragraffe) towards theſe two Prieſts. Within leſſe then a weeke after this arraignment, Maiſter <hi>Ch.</hi> was brought to M. D. <hi>Biſh.</hi> his Chamber, where after they had imbraced each other, they were carried each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a couple of Ieſuites among all the ſtudents, as a beginning of their libertie, (no other cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9135:54"/> pretended of M. D. <hi>Biſh.</hi> his longer impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then that he had to the Cardinalls diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vſed ſilence, when he was licenſed to ſpeake if he would after his examination was redde, and vſed more courage (when he had heard the Libell redde) then was thought conuenient by them; and no other cauſe was giuen of M. <hi>Ch.</hi> his longer impriſonment, but that he ſhould be puniſhed for 3. or 4. dayes for companie, after which they ſhould be both ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and permitted to deale in their buſineſſe (for which they went to <hi>Rome.</hi>) So that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> might haue deuiſed ſome other conceit for the auouching of the long ſtay before the ſentence was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which came before it was looked for, and yet it was 9. weeks in comming) then that the two Cardinalls ſhould ſtaie diuers weekes to enforme his holineſſe, before they gaue ſentence in their cauſe. For firſt they gaue ſentence when they were preſent, in ſo much as both the two Prieſts, and the ſtudents alſo in the Colledge vpon the Ieſuites their owne reports expected, that they ſhould be verie ſhortly ſet at libertie. Secondly, it is vnlikely that the two Cardinalls ſhould diuers weekes be debarred the Popes preſence, or denied audience, or haue any great doubts in ſuch a caſe, as when they heard what was to be ſaid againſt the two Prieſts, they iudged, that they found no other cauſe in them then is aforeſaid. And if the Cardinalls had bene ſo little gratious in the Popes ſight, as in diuers weekes they could not haue audience, this matter being of no more importance then the Iudges (the one a Diuine, the other a Lawier), after conference
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9135:55"/> vpon the examinations read before them, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer made by the two Prieſts to anſwere to what was libelled againſt them, declared it to be, a more milde reſtraint then cloſe impriſonment for other 7. weeks would haue bene no euil edification to ſuch, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that no more rigor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> needs muſt, ſhould haue bene vſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt a couple of Prieſts, who had many yeares aduentured their liues for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and dignitie of the Sea Apoſtolicke.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> hauing in the 11. paragraffe ſhewed to what end the Cardinalls did come to the Colledge, but not what was there done, nor what ſentence was either then, or afterward giuen by them, expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth how with any colour it might be ſaide, that the two Prieſts had wrong, &amp;c. Could hee forget that they were impriſoned with infamie before it was knowne whether they brought any thing worth the handling or no, which himſelfe confeſſed in the 10. paragraffe? Did not he as a moſt vigilent Iaylor, keep the keyes himſelfe, that they ſhould not come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or vſe any meanes to deale in the buſineſſe, in which they were ioyntly imployed? Can hee be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that when the two Proctors libelled againſt them, they were ſo farre from being vnwilling to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the Libell, as their exceeding forwardneſſe in this was pretended a ſufficient cauſe to keepe the one in cloſe priſon, at the leaſt for a fewe dayes, and the other becauſe he was his fellow in this action? Was his memory ſo ſhort, as he could not remember how that the Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> in his hearing (at their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9135:55"/> cleared them from all things, except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they had offended ſome by this their iournie; for ſatisfaction whereof, they were willed to write into England, which they performed to his preſent great liking, although afterward he wrangled with them about the ſame Letters? Can F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſay, that euer they were brought to any anſwere after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, although many things were attempted, and obiected priuately by himſelfe againſt them, and hee willed by them to take what courſe he would, when he pretended matters againſt them from England, whether the Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> had ſent the 10. of Nouember before from <hi>Rome</hi> (in the Popes name as he pretended, who was then at <hi>Ferrara</hi>) for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of their liues and behauiours, who did not accept they knew not of what authoritie, and how lawfully it was ſent, and ſet ouer them, more then what he witneſſed himſelfe, a teſtimonie not bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any to giue credit in ſo waightie a matter, and to the preiudiſe of ſo many, as ſufficient proofe will be made? Or could F. <hi>Parſons</hi> pretending to be a religious man, and of the ſocietie of Ieſus (that is, of a ſocietie inſtituted in the honour of the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) make ſo ſleight a matter of a ſentence of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the confinement of a couple of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Prieſts, who had a long time laboured with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of life, in defence of the Catholique Church, and one of them ſuffered impriſonment for the ſame, without any prouiſion made for them, or ſuffering them to be in one Region together, which had bene one point of humanitie for mutuall comfort in this
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9135:56"/> extremitie, vnleſſe perchance hee will ſay that hee is deuoted onely to the name of Ieſus, and not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelfe to immitate any thing in the perſon? If F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had not ſent word into England, that the Prieſts ſhould continue vnder this ſentence for three yeares, which was more then the two Prieſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues knew, or was conteined in any ſentence that euer they heard, he might haue excuſed himſelfe in part, and not haue bene thought the ſole plotter of this dealing: and if others hearing of theſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings (and many more which for breuitie are heere omitted) haue ſaid, that the two Prieſts had wrong, and had leſſe Iuſtice in <hi>Rome</hi> then is permitted to Turkes and Iewes, they cannot let them to thinke, ſpeake, or write what they iudge beſt.</p>
            <p>Many things doth F. <hi>Parſons</hi> heape together in this 12. Paragraffe; as firſt, that the Cardinalls were aſhamed to finde the two Prieſts to haue come ſo long a iourney with ſo litle to ſay. Secondly, that they brought not ſo much as any one Letter of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from any Communitie, or priuate perſon in ſuch forme, as might giue credit. Thirdly, that euen the ſecret memorialls of their moſt ſecret buſineſſe were ſeene, &amp; found to haue bin of no more waight then the reſt. Fourthly, that they ſhould keepe their chiefe meſſage to themſelues. Fiftly, that they ſaid their fill of the Arch-prieſt, and Ieſuites, and were willed vpon their oathes to ſay more. Sixtly, that the Prieſts were fewe who ſent them, and that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had ſhewed them wel-neare 20. times as many of the ſame order againſt them.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:9135:56"/>
            <p>To the firſt it is well knowne, they had many things to deale in of more importance then are as yet graunted, as the procuring of ordinary Paſtors in Gods Church, or at the leaſtwiſe, authoritie for the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (moſt neceſſarie in time of perſecution, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vaine, and as a ſuperfluous ceremonie in Gods Church) 2. The procuring ſome meanes for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyles, which vſed to come very late to their hands. 3. For the acquietting of ſuch ſtirres as were then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, and were likely (as the euent proueth) to growe daily to the vndoing of our Countrey, and ſuch like. And if F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had thought what would haue followed in the 17. Paragraffe, he would (as I thinke, vnleſſe he were exceedingly ſhameleſſe) haue had more regard what words he had vſed in this 12. Paragraffe; for if that be true, which he there relateth to haue bene depoſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Cardinall and hee had more reaſon to be aſhamed of that which was brought againſt the Arch-prieſt, a creature of their owne, then that the two Prieſts had litle to ſay.</p>
            <p>But if F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſhould be demaunded where this ſhame came vpon the two Cardinalls, or how they came to haue that conceit, that the two Prieſts had come ſo long a iourney with litle to ſay; would he trowe you without bluſhing make an anſwere? The firſt time that the two Prieſts ſawe the Cardinall <hi>Burgheſe,</hi> and at his importunate requeſt, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him ſome part of their buſineſſe, they found him ſo fauourable vnto them, that according to their humble ſute, hee promiſed that he would procure
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9135:57"/> them audience, before they ſhould be iudged, and further them what he could. The firſt time likewiſe that they ſawe the Cardinall <hi>Caietan,</hi> although he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them in very rough tearmes, hee willed them to bring in writing vnto him, what they had to ſay, and tolde them, that he would thereon conſider. And at theſe meetings could neither of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals be aſhamed of that, which the Prieſts had to ſay, for neither of them knew but in generall termes ſome part of their buſineſſe, and appointed therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a farther conference. The ſecond time that theſe two Prieſts ſawe theſe two Cardinalls, was at their arraignment, where the Cardinals might perchance be aſhamed of the inſolencie of their aduerſaries, but could not be aſhamed that the two Prieſts had litle to ſay; for when they were both together, and might haue dealt in their buſineſſe (although with this ſhamefull diſaduantage, that they had all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings taken from them ſeuen weekes before, and all that while kept cloſe priſoners, that they might not ſpeake either each with other, or any body elſe (as they did both deſire) to aske ſome counſel being thus betraied) they dealt as farre forth as was conuenient for them to deale, that is to ſay, for ſo much as they were at that time vrged to deale in, which was vpon occaſion of a Libell put vp againſt them by M. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Haddocke,</hi> and M. <hi>Martin Array,</hi> a couple of Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for the Arch-prieſt: for when this Libell was read, they offered to make their anſwere vnto it, and for that end they demaunded a copie thereof, which at Doctor <hi>Haddocks</hi> earneſt requeſt, (who Proctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9135:57"/> before had put it vp againſt them) was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them; ſo that at this time the Cardinals had more cauſe to be aſhamed of the two Proctors then of the two Prieſts, who were arraigned, and by all likelihood were ſo, for they diſmiſſed the two Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and afterward acquiting the two Prieſts from all matters except one, that was, that by their going to <hi>Rome</hi> many Prieſts and Lay-men in England were ſcandalized, they diſmiſſed them alſo in verie friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, and no caſe was alledged of their farther impriſonment, but an ouer-great forwardnes in the one againſt the Libell, which is an argument that the two Prieſts had ſomewhat to ſay, which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls not being ouer-forward to heare (as it ſhould ſeeme by their not deliuering the Libell to the two Prieſts when they called for it) could not in reaſon be ſaid to be aſhamed that the Prieſts had litle to ſay. The third time, that theſe two Prieſtes did ſee the Cardinalls, was when they went (as they were ſet at libertie) firſt the one, then the other to take their leaues, and ſo to depart to the place of their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at which time alſo the Cardinalls might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance make ſome reflection, but not vpon a thing worthie of ſhame in the two Prieſts, who during the time that they might deale, alwaies offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and performed as much as laie in them, and when they could not deale therein (being ioyned ſo as the one without the other had not to attempt any thing) they patiently ſuffered firſt cloſe impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for 14. weekes with the appurtenances, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a moneths eaſier impriſonment, and laſtly, a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9135:58"/> ſending ſeuerally one after another into baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yea &amp; to be confined each to one Country, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be baniſhed not only out of England their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Countrey, but alſo out of all Countries in the world but one, vpon a ſuppoſall that they had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained controuerſies in one: and thus I leaue this point to any indifferent man to iudge, what cauſe the Cardinals had to be aſhamed, (if they were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> here noteth) and whether F. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> (who was preſent at the arraingment, and ſawe the forwardneſſe of the two Prieſts to make their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to what was obiected againſt them) were hee as he would be thought, could without ſhame inſert this clauſe in his Letter to the two Prieſts, who were then arraigned. And howſoeuer he might forget any other matter, muſt needs remember, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Libell to make their anſwere to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the courage of the one in this very action was pretended by the Ieſuites, to haue bin the cauſe why they were not the ſame night ſet at libertie, becauſe forſooth this was an argument to the Cardinals that he was of a ſtirring ſpirit, and therefore they would for 2. or 3. dayes longer keepe them both in priſon.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, they brought many Letters, from many, as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> and the Proctors in their moodes will confeſſe, although not from any ſetled commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie vnder any head, for from this the Prieſts refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vntill they had ſent vnto his holineſſe, which whileſt they were effecting by common ſuffradge (as became Prieſts) a head was moſt fraudulently by the Ieſuites procured to curbe them, and croſſe them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9135:58"/> in their courſes, which they had intended. And if F. <hi>Parſons</hi> had remembred, that not long after in the 21. paragraffe he telleth them, that they brought certain notes about their meſſage from a principall man of theyr ſide of his owne hande writing, yet there to bee ſeene, whatſoeuer hee had written heere of a communitie, hee would not haue ſaide that they brought no letters of credence from any priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but F. <hi>Parſons</hi> would perchance giue men to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the petitions of Prieſts ſubſcribed with their owne hands, were not of ſo great credence as a brazen face of a Ieſuite (who before his holines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he was a ſecular Prieſt, and ſent by them in their buſineſſe) beeing ſeconded with as falſe a friend to the Prieſts as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelfe a Ieſuite in his owne likeneſſe.</p>
            <p>To the third, if there were ſecret memorialls of moſt ſecret buſineſſe, how was all ſaide by the two Prieſts that they could ſay? How can theſe memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls be termed by F. <hi>Parſons</hi> to be ſecret, if nothing were concealed which was contained in them? and for their weight, if F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſay true in the 17. para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe, they had no need to be of greater weight then the reſt, for F. <hi>Parſons</hi> there confeſſeth that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt was touched, yea in the verie matter of his faith, for that an hereticall propoſition was laide to his charge, as appeareth by their papers, and depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions yet extant, which would hardly be excuſed, if ſuch a thing ſhould be prooued againſt one, who to giue him what F. <hi>Parſons</hi> giueth him (no doubt great commendations) is a man of thoſe parts, and merits,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9135:59"/> that all Engliſh men doo know, or at the leaſt might imagine ſo long as he did not ſhew himſelfe.</p>
            <p>To the fourth, I know not what was their chiefe meſſage, nor where they had any conuenient time or place to vtter it, or any other, being clapped vp cloſe priſoners before they came to doo any thing, and neuer after ſuffered to be together at libertie in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the fift, a reaſon is giuen before, why it was no wiſedome for them to ſay their fill, either of the one, or the other, being in cuſtodie of the one, who was the more carefull of his charge in reſpect of the other. Yet if F. <hi>Parſons</hi> be not ouer forgetfull, he may call to mind that about a moneth after their arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vpon ſome occaſion of ſpeech betweene M. <hi>Ch.</hi> and him, M. <hi>Ch.</hi> told him of ſome matters, which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> pretended hee had not heard before, and ſeemed to be aſtoniſhed at them, wherby at the leaſt this may be gathered, that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> very raſhly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that they had ſaid their fill at any time.</p>
            <p>To the ſixt, (to omit what meanes and threats the Ieſuites, and the Arch-prieſt did vſe himſelfe to be accepted for their ſuperiour) they could not expect to carry many Prieſts handes in teſtimonie of their minds, (who foreſawe what would come of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie procured by the Ieſuites for their better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the Prieſtes) leaſt their ſtaie ſhould be threatned downe vppon his holineſſe (by ſuch as would let ſlip no opportunitie) to be a generall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance thereof. The authoritie being ſent into England (as the Prieſts were enformed) to be firſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9135:59"/> liked, before it ſhould be confirmed vpon them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> In the 13. Paragraffe there is too much want ſhewed both of wit, and memorie, modeſtie, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie. Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> would know firſt how it could be ſaid vpon a litle part or faction (as he termeth it) that Catholiques are intollerably afflicted, beeing perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at home, &amp; cannot be heard abroad. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he asketh who are thoſe Catholiques. Thirdly, he boldly demaundeth, what audience is denied to them; as who would ſay, no audience was denied to them. Fourthly, he would inſinuate that the Prieſts, who hold with the Ieſuits and Arch-prieſt, are more perſecuted, and hated by the Councell of England, then the other Prieſts. Fiftly, he excuſeth the Pope for not giuing audience to the two Prieſts.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, it is anſwered, firſt that a litle part of Catholiques may be called Catholiques; ſecondly, that all Catholiques are intollerably afflicted at home, and cannot be heard abroad, while they make ſute as they are bound to doo for ſuch things, as are moſt neceſſarie for Chriſtians liuing in perſecution, and are wanting, in England and cannot be obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as the Sacrament of confirmation, of which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> could not be ignorant, when he writ theſe Letters, nor long before hauing viewed, and review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the petitions of the Prieſts, which thoſe two carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them to <hi>Rome.</hi> Alſo the vnion of all Prieſts together; which (as it ſhould ſeeme by that which hath followed Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> courſes) was but ſlubbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer for a ſmall time by him, and his fellowes, or adherents who quickly after both by writing,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9135:60"/> and tongue detraction began to refreſh the former wound.</p>
            <p>To his ſecond demaund if he ſhould be ſatisfied, and the Catholiques named, the ſatisfaction would be as fooliſhly giuen, as the queſtion was asked: hee might with much leſſe daunger to Catholiques ſay, who they were not; for I do ſuppoſe, that either there are none ſo careleſſe of their owne good, or their friends, but they deſired what is before mentioned ſhould haue bene demaunded, and is not graunted, or at the leaſt none ſo ſhameleſſe, as they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer ſo great a careleſneſſe in themſelues of matters of ſo great weight.</p>
            <p>To the third, this anſwere may bee made, that doubtleſſe he tooke a vizard when he writ it: what audience ſaith F. <hi>Parſons</hi> is there denied them? were they not with infamie caſt into priſon before it was knowne, whether they brought any thing worth the handling, as is ſhewed out of the 10. Paragraffe? And doth not F. <hi>Parſons</hi> in this ſame 13. Paragraffe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that they were not heard by his holineſſe, to whom they went for audience? how could he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo fewe lines forget himſelfe?</p>
            <p>To the fourth it may be truly anſwered, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Prieſts who haue bene put to death the leaſt part (if any at all) haue bene for the Ieſuites, or Arch-prieſt. And if any difference hath bene made in their perſecutions, it hath bene in ſhewing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary fauour to the Ieſuites, and their adherents, as will be prooued by their vſage of F. <hi>Heywood,</hi> M. <hi>Martin Array,</hi> and ſuch like. But if it could be proued,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9135:60"/> that the Ieſuites, the Arch-prieſt, and ſuch other Prieſts as are knowne to be guided by them were more perſecuted, yea and hated by the Councell of England, then the other Prieſts, who are not guided by the Ieſuites, perchance this reaſon might be giuen thereof, that the Councell haue found by the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites Letters, which they haue often intercepted, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by ſome bookes of theirs, that they came not ſo much into England to ſet forward Religion, as they would be thought to do, and as the other Prieſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend vnto, but to further a ſtate faction, and to deale therein more then becommeth religious men to doo.</p>
            <p>It is a world to ſee how he buſieth himſelfe in this kinde, if the Prieſts embrace his plottes for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne inuaſion or ciuil wars in our owne Countrie, they are ſubiect to moſt grieuous death due to tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; if they do not, the fauour which they may finde at their better enformed aduerſaries hands, muſt bee their perpetuall ignominie. Yet doth F. <hi>Parſons</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline rather to include all the Prieſts within the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of high treaſon, and to this end this ground is laid. All that do not like his proceedings or his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of matters of ſtate, do meddle more in matters of ſtate, then he or any other: and that this is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence made of any his words, or writings, but his very ground, his Letters written or dictated to M. <hi>Martin Array,</hi> of the 18. of Ianuary doth euidently prooue, where he followeth his owne conceit, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting one propoſition from an other vntil a <hi>primo ad vltimum</hi> hee maketh this argument. The two
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9135:61"/> Prieſts were to make a Petition, that all books ſhould be forbidden, which did without need or profit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate the ſtate of England, <hi>Ergo</hi> they medled in matters of ſtate more, and offended now the preſent ſtate, then by any other way that is yet knowne; and that no man haue hereof any doubt, I haue ſet down the poſtſcript, word for word as it is in the aforeſaid Letter concerning this point.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt omitted one particular, which ſhall not be euill for you to know, and that is that among other points of Commiſſion deliuered in writing to theſe two Embaſſadors, one principall was noted in all their latter Letters, that no bookes ſhould bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that offended the preſent ſtate of England in matters of ſtate, or exaſperate the aduerſaries; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they being examined what bookes or booke they meant in particular, ſaid it was the booke of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. And being demaunded farther whether any particular perſecution had bene mooued hithervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by that booke, or any man put to death for hauing it in this three or foure yeares ſince it was written, they ſaid that they knew of none. Then was it asked them why there was more grudging then, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt this booke that had mooued no perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, then againſt D. <hi>Sanders Monarchia,</hi> and booke <hi>de Schiſmate,</hi> &amp; D. <hi>Briſtowes Motiues,</hi> for which diuers in particular haue bene put to death; as alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt D. <hi>Allen</hi> late Cardinall, his booke <hi>Contra iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Britanicam,</hi> D. <hi>Stapleton</hi> his <hi>Dydimus,</hi> M. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> againſt <hi>Whitakers,</hi> &amp; ſuch others, who are much more earneſt againſt the preſent ſtate, then this other
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9135:61"/> booke of ſucceſſion, which ſpeaketh ſo mildely and indifferently as he can iuſtly offend no parte. And how our ſpirituall maiſters being not able to anſwer, diſcouered themſelues, and their fellowes vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſpirit, and religion, to be <hi>Scotiſts</hi> in faction, without any reſpect of religion at all there, but being to ſet vp a knowne hereticke, and therby alſo to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle more in matters of ſtate, and to offend now the preſent ſtate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by any other way that is yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. So as in this they haue neither reaſon, religion, nor ſtate with them, but only aemulation, follie, and faction, &amp;c. Thus much <hi>verbatim</hi> out of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Letter of the 18. of Ianuary. 1599.</p>
            <p>Wit whither wilt thou? Are not theſe fellows de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of this kinde of ſport, who rather then they wil faile of their deſignes, ſticke not to accuſe innocent men of medling in matters of ſtate, and ſetting vp a King in England, the verie talke whereof is a thing moſt hatefull, and daungerous there, and to bring them into no leſſe daunger, and hatred in <hi>Rome,</hi> they amplifie the matter with this Epitheton; a knowne hereticke. And vpon what ground ſay they this? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth becauſe their ſpirituall maiſters (as they ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly tearme the two Prieſts) being asked why the booke of ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was more diſliked then any other named vnto them, were not able to anſwere. <hi>Ergo,</hi> conclude theſe fellowes, they diſcouered themſelues and their fellowes to be <hi>Scotiſts</hi> in faction. How fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth this vpon the antecedent? how would theſe ſimple <hi>Statiſts</hi> haue ſported themſelues, if any their diſcourſes or traines could haue taken the leaſt hold vpon either of the two Prieſts? how much more to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:9135:62"/> purpoſe might this concluſion be deduced out of this poſtſcript, that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> dooth but cogge with the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> in his flattering Letters to ſome of his Nobilitie, or that there is litle conſtancie in him and his followers toward any, longer then they thinke it may make for their aduantage without any due regard to conſcience, right, truth, reaſon, or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in their dealings? hauing chopped and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Crowne of England 8. or 9. ſeuerall times, to ſeuerall perſons, as it pleaſed him and his to play with it, and as little boyes ſport themſelues with <hi>King by your leaue,</hi> now the great ones euery hand-while do crie, <hi>A new King, a new,</hi> ſuch an one, as (if F. <hi>Parſons</hi> his word be of any credit) hee ſhall thinke to be the moſt likely to carry it from the reſt, which might be thought to haue bene ſpoken in ieſt, had not ſome of his fellowes practiſed the ſame in <hi>France,</hi> who while the king who now is, was in daunger of being debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that kingdome, were moſt earneſt againſt him, and ſtood moſt ſtoutly for other who were likely to haue it, but when they ſawe him brought into <hi>Paris,</hi> they were the firſt religious that went to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late him, although not long after there were ſuch proofes againſt them, that one was publikely execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt his Ma. perſon, &amp; the reſt bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thoſe parts of <hi>France.</hi> And here alſo it appeareth howe greatly they wanted matter againſt the two Prieſts, that to prooue them to meddle more in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtate, and to offend now the preſent ſtate, then by any other way that was then knowne, they are driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſo miſerable a refuge, as to ſay that one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9135:62"/> point of Commiſſion deliuered in writing to the two Embaſſadors (as they terme them) was, that no bookes ſhould be admitted that offended the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of England in matters of ſtate, or exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the aduerſaries, <hi>Ergo</hi> they medled in matters of ſtate; but to omit their not ouerwiſe illations, there is no truth in their relation. For when they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by F. <hi>Parſons</hi> what bookes were ment in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, they ſaid that they ment all ſuch, as their petition did include, and being intreated by F. <hi>Parſons</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to ſay whether the booke of ſucceſſion were not ment for one, anſwere was made that it was one, which did much offend, and to the reply which was fooliſhly made, why that booke ſhould offend more then other, which are named in this poſtſcript; they anſwered to F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> that they named this no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other, as appeared by their petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although iuſt exception might be taken more againſt this, then any other, becauſe it did conuince that thing to be true, which our aduerſaries alwaies obiected againſt Prieſts, that was, that they dealt in ſtate matters, and that the Councell being ſo well aſſured thereof, and able to giue ſo good a ſatisfaction for their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, might afflict Catholickes more then euer they did, although they did not deſcend to this particular cauſe thereof, or proofe againſt them, the Spaniards hauing often attempted by warres to inuade our Country, to which this booke doth intitle them. In this I am ſomewhat longer then I entended, becauſe I would note what libertie F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do vſe in their pennes, who being to this effect
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9135:63"/> anſwered to thoſe queſtions in the poſtſcript, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and contrary to their own knowledge affirme, that their ſpiritual maiſters (ſo terming the 2. Prieſts) were not able to make any anſwer to their profound queſtions, and conclude moſt abſurdly therevpon, that the two Prieſts diſcouered themſelues to deale more in matters of ſtate, and offend the preſent ſtate, then by any other way that was yet knowne.</p>
            <p>If ſome Ieſuites exhorting their hearers to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ſinne, or more particularly from all ſinful diſſimulation, &amp; falſhood, as a thing hatefull to God, hurtfull to their ſoules, and a mortall enemie to all humane fellowſhip, ſhould be asked whether they ment ſuch a ſinne, or ſuch a diſſimulation in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and after anſwere made, that they ment that and all the like, ſhould be vrged why that more then the like, and were not able to giue a reaſon thereof; how would it followe that theſe ſpirituall maiſters were hipocrites, which is to vſe diſſimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the higheſt degree? or to be the notableſt diſſembling compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that euer were knowne? Could the Ieſuites trow you admit this conſequence as true, although they ſhould know in their conſcience that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent were moſt true? Thus &amp; no othervviſe play theſe pious, and conſtant champions againſt the two Prieſts, and as the ſpirit moueth them, ſometime the Embaſſadours, ſometime their ſpirituall maiſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make petition that no bookes ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that offended the preſent ſtate in matters of ſtate, or exaſperate the aduerſaries, and not able to anſwer why this booke ſhould be more blamed then
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9135:63"/> any other (as they ſay, although moſt falſely and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently to their petition) prooue <hi>Statists (Scotists</hi> in faction as they tearme them) and readie to ſet vp a knowne Hereticke, and to meddle more in matters of ſtate, then euer any was knowne to do. Would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Scotiſt</hi> or <hi>Sotiſt</hi> haue made ſuch a reaſon? it would beſt fit a <hi>Sottiſt</hi> that neither cared what <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaid, or <hi>Sotus,</hi> but runne vpon <hi>omne vtile honeſtum,</hi> that which may make for our purpoſe, be it what it will be, that is pietie, that is conſtancie, that is ſtate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion alſo. And thus much for the 4. point, touched in the 13. Paragraffe.</p>
            <p>To the fift it may be anſwered, that the meſſage of the two Prieſts being about other matters then the Ieſuites quarels at <hi>Rome</hi> with the Students, F. <hi>Parſons</hi> might haue made ſome better excuſe for the Pope his honor, which he vndertook in the fift Paragraffe to defend; and alſo haue ſomewhat remembred, how boldly he had in this ſame Paragraffe demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what audience was denied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But ouer ſhooes ouer bootes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> In the 14. Paragraffe he beginneth as he ſaith, to make his owne defence, in which he ſpeaketh for himſelfe, and in commendation of his owne good nature, and for proofe of his good carriage towards the two Prieſts, he referreth them to that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ſaid; which I know not whether it argue folly, or forgetfulneſſe, or both. One good deed here he doth name, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning a lapſed prieſt, which being penitent for his fault, went to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which you ſhall ſeldome heare by any Ieſuite, when
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:9135:64"/> he hath forſaken the Catholique faith; of which if a man might without offence make a coniecture, hee might thinke, that the Ieſuites their fall (without ſome ſpeciall miracle) is incurable, as many examples may be giuen of ſome in <hi>England,</hi> ſome in <hi>Geneua,</hi> ſome in other places, and they growe to be the moſt notorious companions that liue; but for the Prieſts who are much talked of, if any of them do faile heere in England, for the moſt part, they haue had alwaies remorſe of conſcience after the firſt heat, and ſo haue liued vntil they could finde ſome opportunity to riſe againe; and ſome of them hauing failed perchance in reſpect of diſcontentment vpon the hard dealing of the Ieſuites, or their adherents (who vnder one pretence or other doo vſe to trie whether the Prieſts be confirmed in grace) haue ſpent their ſpeeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, happily not without cauſe, which is no proofe for the Ieſuites goodneſſe more, then it were an argument for the goodneſſe of the diuell, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yea wicked people raile againſt him; but for that man in particular, I thinke F. <hi>Parſons</hi> cannot charge him, that euer he did any harme to any Ieſuite, but to the ſecular Prieſts he did very much, which could not ſtand with any good liking vnto them, and if herevpon a Parentheſis ſhould be made as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> maketh his (that falling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God and diſlike of the ſecular Prieſts, or rayling againſt them, commonly go together) the Ieſuites and their adherents would think that they were greatly iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who for a ſhewe onely, &amp; for the better effecting of that, which they intend, ſeeme to beare good will

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> In the 17. Paragraffe many things are touched: firſt, an haeretical propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſaid to haue bin depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt M. <hi>Blackwell,</hi> which if it bee true, how is it ſaid in the 8. Paragraffe, that the Pope foreſaw that they did not expect any matter of ſubſtance againſt his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Of what ſubſtance againſt a mans go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in an heretical country ſuch a depoſition is, any Catholique will eaſily ſee, &amp; ought to reflect the more vpon it, if it were in matters directly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And how in the 10. Paragraffe can F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſay that they had made a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without any foundation at all, which the Cardinalls ſhould at firſt ſuſpect, and after finde it to be true, and alſo be aſhamed that the two Prieſts came ſo long a iourney with ſo litle to ſay, as he affirmeth in the 12. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe? Secondly, F. <hi>Parſons</hi> affirmeth alſo, that the two Prieſtes would haue diſcredited ſuch Engliſh Prieſts, as ſtood with the Arch-prieſt, and were the principall of their coat, but in what it is not ſaid, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance it is meant, in that theſe two and other in not accepting of an authoritie, pretended to come from the Pope without the Popes Letters, or other ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent teſtimonie, might argue the other of an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great forwardneſſe, in that they did without more examining of the matter, yeeld vnto it; but how the Ieſuites are drawne hereby in diſcredit, I conceiue not, vnleſſe perchance this authority being procured by the Ieſuites, it might be thought a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that (being aduerſaries to the ſecular Prieſts) they might not be truſted to chooſe a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:9135:65"/> for them, who ſhould bee an Arbiter betwixt them; which conſtuction I am induced to make, both vpon the manner of F. <hi>Parſons</hi> bringing in the Ieſuites with thoſe Prieſts, whom hee ſaith the two that went to <hi>Rome</hi> tooke the way to diſcredit, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vpon that which followeth in this ſame 17. para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe. For I do not thinke, that F. <hi>Parſons</hi> will attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute that which followeth to any, but to himſelfe, who (if himſelfe be of any credit) made choiſe of the Arch-prieſt as one, that would runne with the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites which were at variance with the ſecular Prieſts. Thoſe other things which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> in this 17. para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe ſaith ſhould haue bene propoſed, would not haue bene propoſed without ſome ground. For the firſt, the Protector was knowne to be allied to the contrary part, and ſaid to be ruled altogether againſt thoſe, whoſe Protector he pretended to be. For the ſecond, the Seminaries were in perpetual garboyles, and as nurſeries of ſtrife and debate betweene the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, &amp; the ſecular Prieſts. For the third, the Ieſuites who were in England, aſpired daily to that, which became them not. Which firſt was attempted by them at <hi>Wisbitch</hi> moſt manifeſtly, and afterward was gotten after a more ſecret manner, while one in the likeneſſe of a ſecular Prieſt beareth the name of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour ouer the reſt, and the Ieſuites rule him, and them alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> Concerning the 18. paragraffe, that queſtion of hauing two Arch-prieſts in England, was neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, nor any thing elſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the two Prieſts were not ſuffered to ſpeak together about any thing,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:9135:66"/> but Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> (examining by how many meanes peace might bee kept in England) was anſwered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other, that were named, that this might be one, not that one ſhould be oppoſite againſt the other, as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> would make the world belieue, but that the ſtrife in Englande beeing betweene the ſecular Prieſts, and the Ieſuites, and the Arch-prieſt guided by the Ieſuites, it was fit that there ſhould be a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſt who was not gouerned by the Ieſuites in the like authoritie with the Archprieſt, and that ſuch lawes might be made, that neither part would be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-haſtie to offend other; at which diſputation, Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> ouerſhot himſelfe fowly. Firſt in arguing that it was neuer ſeene that there ſhould bee in any one country two ſuperiors, &amp; the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the other; for himſelf had procured the ſame in England by this new gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as appeareth by that the Arch-prieſt is not, or muſt not be ſaid to be ſubordinate to the ſuperiour of the Ieſuites, nor this to him, but this inſtance at his requeſt was not vrged. Then vpon an other inſtance giuen him of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> &amp; <hi>Yorke,</hi> he went about to proue a ſubordination betweene theſe Arch-biſhops, out of a fooliſh hardineſſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> to take the vpper place of the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> at a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond: and the good Fa. would not in a long time vnderſtand, that that ſtrife prooued no more that there was, or is a ſubordination betweene theſe Arch-biſhops, then the ſtrife betweene the two Embaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> for the higher place (when they meete)
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:9135:66"/> doth proue, that one of theſe Kings is ſubordinate to the other. But to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this paragraffe, if all things were ſo well ended in England, and all ſo happily v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> here confeſſeth, why were not M. <hi>B.</hi> and M. <hi>C.</hi> ſent home, but kept ſtill in baniſhment, &amp; relegation without any prouiſion made for them to liue? What conſtancy was in this I know not, in ſhewe there was but litle pietie, eſpecially, if through their meanes this vnitie was wrought, as I haue bene credibly enformed it was vpon the ſight of their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Breue which was ſent into Englande with their teſtimony to it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> What Hiſtorie that is of the Colledge, which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> rehearſeth in the 19. paragraffe, to draw men to ſend their children thither, I know not. But if it be true, which I haue heard ſome Prieſts ſpeake, that they haue bene exhorted at <hi>Rome</hi> by Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> to thruſt themſelues into ſtate practiſes, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereto, becauſe by being Prieſts they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie condemned for traytors, and could ſuffer no greater indignities, or more cruell death for that, then for this; and that alſo be true which likewiſe I haue heard other ſay, how he practiſed with the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in <hi>Spaine</hi> to ſet to their hands to ſuch like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the Infant, I do not ſee how any wiſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique in England or elſewhere, ſhould be ouer-haſtie to ſend his children, either to the one place, or the other. Neither do I knowe what M. <hi>Ch.</hi> threatned: F. <hi>Parſons</hi> in modeſtie, and honeſtie, might haue vſed better termes, then that he ſhould bemone the lacke of libertie; for litle reaſon God-wot he had (if it had

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> In the 20.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> In the 21. Paragraffe, F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſheweth himſelfe moſt willing to deliuer the two Prieſtes from any thing which he had written againſt them, or willed others to write. I will not heere repeate that which is ſufficiently before ſhewed, how willingly in this Letter he hath himſelfe written, whatſoeuer he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led others to write. He acknowledgeth that he did euer attribute their attempt rather to error, and lacke of conſideration, then to ambition, although in the firſt Paragraffe he ſeemeth to excuſe their attempt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and attributeth the euill ſucceſſe thereof to their owne defaults, as if they had handled ſome good matter not in good ſort, as once a moſt reuerend and graue Prelate ſeriouſly tolde them that ſome others had done in a matter betweene them and the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites. If they ſhould not acknowledge errour, and lacke of conſideration in this their attempt, they might iuſtly be blamed, althought perchance that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and lack of conſideration, grew vpon too good an opinion conceiued of ſome in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by others lately come from thence, and therevpon they made not ſuch prouiſion for theyr owne ſafetie, and their ſo free dealing in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, as they might haue made, litle ſuſpecting, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:9135:68"/> comming ſo farre to ſpeake with his Holineſſe in matters of the Church, which required conference not onely each with other, but with others alſo, they ſhould not be ſuffered to ſpeake one with the other, or any man elſe to aske counſell therein, vntill after ſome two or three dayes after the Breue was gotten, at what time they were licenſed to come together, and were in ſcorne bidden to deale in their matters for which they were ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi> But although F. <hi>Parſons</hi> did euer as he ſaith, attribute this their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, rather to errour, and lacke of conſideration, then to ambition, yet leaſt that birds of one feather ſhould flie too farre aſunder, hee giueth heere ſome reaſons, why men might thinke that ambition did make the two Prieſts to take this action in hand, to giue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderſtand of his ready mind to hold vp his fellow F. <hi>Bald.</hi> in this vntruth, of which although M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> in his anſwere to this Letter of F. <hi>Parſons</hi> doth ſufficiently diſcourſe, yet it will not be amiſſe to ſay ſomewhat here concerning F. <hi>Parſons</hi> proofes. For the firſt proofe I haue ſpoken with ſuch as gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the petitions, which the Prieſts did make, and they doo aſſure me, that M. <hi>C.</hi> was not propoſed by any to be made a Biſhop. M. <hi>B.</hi> was, but if M. <hi>C.</hi> did carrie thoſe writings and kept thoſe ſecret from M. <hi>B.</hi> wherein he was named, what proofe is this againſt M. <hi>B.?</hi> To the ſecond proofe, I may anſwere as once I heard an anſwere made for F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> when it was reported heere in England, that all the boyes at S. <hi>Omers</hi> had conſpired to make him a Cardinall, and had written ſuch effectuall Letters to the Pope
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:9135:68"/> for it, that (as it was heere reported) both he, and the generall of the Ieſuites, yea and all the friends that they could make in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> were little inough to keepe him from being a Cardinall, which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> could not helpe; for who can hinder Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be written by ſuch as are many hundred miles diſtant from them? But I maruell who ſhould write this Letter, or whether F. <hi>Parſons</hi> did euer ſhewe it to theſe 2. Prieſts, ſo as they might ſee it &amp; read it? To the third proofe, M. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith, he could neuer obtain ſo much fauour of F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> as to ſee thoſe notes, and as I am enformed, M. <hi>Ch.</hi> ſaith the ſame, although he were moſt importunate with them (eſpecially vpon their ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> promiſes) eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntil the laſt houre of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or aboad at <hi>Rome,</hi> yea &amp; chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged it, that it was forged.

If the cauſe betweene the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt and all the Prieſts were ended, how were the two Prieſts ſtill kept in baniſhment? but wee muſt heere learne a new trick, how to haue all things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and forgotten.

So may the Potent oppreſſe whom they may by might, or fraud, and all is well, yea and all is forgotten, if thoſe who are oppreſſed beare themſelues well, and prudently, and do ſtay, and not ſtirre vp ſuch as do ſeeme to fauour or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone their caſe. But perchance theſe reports which came to F. <hi>Parſons</hi> eares from <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> may be ſaid to haue bene the hinderance that all was not well on the two Prieſts ſides (for as it ſhould ſeeme in the ſixt Paragraffe, they were not come to the eares of them, whom they are ſaid moſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne) but then before theſe reports came to the eares either of the one, or of the other, how was all well, and all forgotten, and yet the two Prieſts kept ſtill in baniſhment? there are Leters vnder Fa. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> hand to be ſeene, to teſtifie that all was well, and vnder F. <hi>Warfords</hi> hand likewiſe, and others doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe enough to the ſame purpoſe, before theſe things were obiected againſt them, or this deuiſe wrought for the farther perſecuting the two Prieſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying them ſtill in baniſhment, and confinement, without any prouiſion made for them to liue, why were they not then diſmiſſed? Perchance F. <hi>Parſons</hi> did at that time diuine, that the two Prieſts might giue ſome cauſe, that notwithſtanding all was well ended, and as he truſted on all hands forgotten, yet
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9135:70"/> their particular cauſe might be exempted from that all, and not onely not be forgotten, but proſecuted ſtill vnto the vttermoſt that the ſtraungeſt moode could deuiſe. Vpon this therefore his diuination, and great foreſight, notwithſtanding that perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, or poſitiuely hee ſaid in the 18. Paragraffe, that all was well ended, and iterateth the ſame in this 22. Paragraffe, and truſteth that alreadie all is forgotten on all hands, yet he ſauceth it with a condition, that is, if M. <hi>B.</hi> and M. <hi>C.</hi> do beare themſelues well, and prudently, and do ſtay, and not ſtirre vp ſuch as do ſeeme to fauour, or bemone their caſe. Now all good Catholiques in England do hartily grieue at the preſent ſtirres in England. M. <hi>B.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> were farre inough off; who hath begunne them? All thoſe who did ſeeme to fauour, or bemoane the caſe of M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> had made an attonement with their aduerſaries, and forgiuen all thoſe ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and detractious proceedings which were prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed againſt them: and neither of themſelues, or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> haue they reuiued all that which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> heere confeſſeth to haue bene dead, forgotten, or ended. Did not rather F. <hi>Rob. Ion.</hi> a Ieſuite (no great fauourer or bemoaner of M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> their caſe) broach this diuiſion again, and renew the ſoare (which was, if not cleane healed, yet forgotten, and the offendors forgiuen) by publiſhing that the Prieſts (who did forbeare to admit M. <hi>Black.</hi> for their ſuperiour, vntill they ſawe the Breue in his confirmation) were Schiſmatikes, and that all thoſe, who ſhould not hold the ſame, were vnder the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9135:71"/> of the Church? Did not M. <hi>Black.</hi> ſoone after, both approue the ſame paradox of F. <hi>Ion.</hi> the Ieſuite, and furthermore publiſh a reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſent (as he ſaid) from <hi>Rome,</hi> eyther by Father <hi>Waſord</hi> or F. <hi>Titch.</hi> (both Ieſuites) which avowed the ſame, with many Edicts, and prohibitions, vnder paine of incurring the cenſures, that the Prieſts ſhould not defend them ſelues from this moſt abſurd, &amp; iniurious calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Was it ſo neceſſary that there ſhould be tumults in England (which muſt be ſaid ſtill, no doubt, to be betweene the ſecular Prieſts, and the Catholiques) that the Ieſuites muſt ſtil giue the onſet, although for to auoyd blame in the opinion of ſuch as will blinde themſelues, their enterpriſes haue bene ſo proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by couert Ieſuites (who were not knowne but as ſecular Prieſts) &amp; by the Arch-prieſt, as they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taken for quarrels among the ſecular Prieſts? Can F. <hi>Parſons</hi> ſay, and not thinke to be laughed at, that theſe ſtirres are reviued by default of M. <hi>Biſh.</hi> and M. <hi>Ch.</hi> their not prudent bearing themſelues, or that the Ieſuites, and the Arch-prieſt were ſtirred vp by them, as men who would ſeeme to fauour, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone their cauſe? But had peace long continued in England, which was feared that it would, (had it bin in their power who were ſo maruellouſly iniured) ſome iudged that they ſhould miſſe ſomewhat at which they aimed, and therefore they ſet all things worſe then they were before. We hope we ſhal now ſhortly at the leaſt ſee to what end they did it.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> Concerning the 23. paragraffe, I cannot ſay what either ſtraungers, or others, did iudge of the two
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9135:71"/> Prieſts cauſe, they themſelues muſt anſwere how they found ſuch as with whom they talked; yet if it be true, which F. <hi>Parſons</hi> relateth in the 16. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe, it is very likely, that they tolde ſome tale, which caried ſome weight with it, or elſe both the Commiſſarie of the Inquiſition had litle reaſon to vſe ſuch words as F. <hi>Parſons</hi> there ſaith he did, and F. <hi>Parſons</hi> leſſe cauſe to feare leaſt their dealing with all the Cardinalls, and great men in <hi>Rome,</hi> would (to vſe his owne tearme) bring the common cauſe in a pretie plight.

The iudgement of the two Cardinals <hi>Caietan, &amp; Burgheſe,</hi> I ſaw in their letters of the 21. of April, 1599. to the Rector or vicerector of the engliſh Colledge, and that was, that it was not expedient that the two Prieſtes ſhould by and by returne vnto thoſe parts, where they had maintained controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with other of their order. Wherefore they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the two Prieſts, that for a time they ſhould not preſume to goe without licenſe, into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> I haue bene credibly enformed that neither of them were euer in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore could not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any controuerſies there in parſonall preſence, but if they did maintaine any, it was by Letters, which they might doo (notwithſtanding this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſo) from other parts alſo, neither can I learne
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:9135:72"/> that euer they mainteined any ſuch in <hi>England,</hi> but if they had, in my ſimple iudgement, it was no good reaſon why therefore they ſhould be debarred <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and although this were the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was ſpecified by the aforeſaid Letters, yet there was an other iudgement alſo, that they ſhould not be both in one Regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it ſhould ſeeme; for although in the Cardinall <hi>Burgheſe</hi> his Letters of the 15. of September, 1600. to M. <hi>C.</hi> it is inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they might chooſe their place of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confinement, (which is a confeſſion) that becauſe they had controuerſies in ſome one place, not certainely ſet downe where, (if wee looke into the aforeſaid mentioned Letters of the 21. of Aprill, 1599.) or becauſe by their returne into England, ſome controuerſies might haue growne there (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by Cardinall <hi>Burgheſe</hi> his Letters of the 15. of September, 1600.) they muſt be baniſhed out of all places in the world but one, where they muſt liue in relegation God knoweth how long (for neither is there any certaine time ſet downe for this) yet in the anſwere vnto it, written by M. <hi>C.</hi> the 4. of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umber following, I read that he was not ſuffered to be in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as he had made his choiſe; and if this was not cauſe ſufficient for honeſt men truly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the ending of their cauſe to bemoane them ſincerely, and from the heart, yet with this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance at the leaſt it might be, that no prouiſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for them to ſuſtaine life, they were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of all ſuch places, where they might haue meanes to liue, vpon a ſuppoſed cauſe neuer proued againſt

               <hi>ſwere to Fa. Parſons Letter, of the 9. of October.</hi> 1599.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Letters (<hi>Father</hi>) of the 9. of Octob. came late vnto my hands, being by you ſent about (as it were in circuit) open; to be read &amp; cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out by diuers others before they ſhould come vnto me. Meete it was ſurely, that ſo odde a ſtorie might not runne the ordinarie courſe of vulgar Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: but againſt the propertie of miſſiues, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary alſo to common ciuility, be communicated firſt to others, and laſt to him, vnto whom they principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong. Yet truly when I heard of others, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and contents of them, I had no great delight to looke vpon them, but let them lie by me more then a moneth, ere I read them once ouer, ſo vnwilling haue I alwaies bene, and yet am, to giue my minde to ſuch troubleſome buſineſſe, which is like to drawe me from a deſired repoſe, into the liſts of an vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing diſpute: and that with thoſe who pretend to be (as in equitie they ſhould be) my verie good friends. I had alſo long before often heard of many ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rumors raiſed of me vniuſtly, and ſeene ſome
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9135:73"/> flying Letters ſtuffed full of miſconſtruction of my actions: yet I remained ſilent, not without the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of diuers honeſt and wiſe perſonages, for that I ſpared to write in defence of my owne innocencie, and to purge and cleare my ſelfe from iniurious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny. But I knowing my poore credit to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſmall moment: and fearing leaſt to treate of ſuch a pittifull ſubiect, might be ſome hinderance vnto the Catholique cauſe: did preferre the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good before my priuate intereſt; our bleſſed Lords honour before mine owne reputation; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto his omnipotent diuine diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and euent of the whole matter. And ſo putting vp patiently thoſe iniuries, paſſed ouer the time in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence quietly, vntill that now (<hi>Father</hi>) you haue by addreſſing ſuch Letters vnto mee, rowſed mee (as it were) out of my quiet Lodge, and doo preſſe mee, either to acknowledge for true, that which I take in many pointes to ſwarue much from the truth, or to declare and ſhewe what I knowe concerning thoſe matters. Wherefore being verie ſure that the honour of God his cauſe cannot be ſtained by a true defence of my ſelfe his poore ſeruant from diſhonour, and that it needeth not (as the Prophet ſaith) our lying, but is rather by truth and equitie vpholden &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. I will ſet downe the veritie of that affaire (as before almightie God my iuſt Iudge) moſt ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and withall, ſo temperately, as that no vpright and in different Reader ſhall haue reaſon to be offended with me. Yet to ſpeake (after my manner) plainly, I cannot (<hi>Father</hi>) but miſtruſt, leaſt you will not take it
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:9135:74"/> well, for you haue alreadie ſhewed your ſelfe to haue bene mooued with my former Letters, which only had friendly requeſts and admonitions: how much the more are theſe likely to trouble you, which carry in them alſo, free, yet friendly reprehenſions; which vnto a high and hotte ſtomacke are of much harder digeſtion? But to mittigate the matter, conſider I pray you, how vnwillingly, and as it were enforced by your ſelfe, I come at length to ſet penne to paper: and what liberties by God and all good men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vnto all ſorts of perſons, ſpeaking in their own defence: and then remembring how you haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in accuſing of vs a rethoricall licenſe, you cannot in equitie and reaſon, but approue and like in vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, a modeſt, Chriſtian libertie of ſpeech. And ſo deſiring you to prepare your ſelfe vnto ſome ſmall patience, I come now to the anſwere of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>In the beginning whereof you write, that no one Letter appeared as then from mee to you, accuſing my long ſilence, and within ten lines after, you ſay, that that weeke you receiued a Letter from me of an old date, to the which you anſwere. What Riddle I pray you may this be? No Letter appeared from me to you when you began to write: and yet that week you had receiued a Letter from mee, what? was the Letter you receiued inuiſible, that it appeared not in his likeneſſe when you receiued it? Yet it appeareth by your particular replie vnto the parts thereof, that you had throughly ſeene and peruſed it. To ſay that after you began your Letter you were a weeke ere
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9135:74"/> you came vnto the tenth line of it, &amp; that mine came in the meane ſeaſon, were ridiculous. What then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, but that in the firſt period of your Letter, there is either ſome egregious equiuocation, or eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vntruth, which fell out (by God his prouidence as I take it) verie fitly, to forewarne your Readers what credit they may giue vnto much of that which followeth. For, if in the verie firſt lines they find ſuch apparant vanitie, voluntarily vttered without anie iuſt cauſe; let them iudge what concluſion and dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is like to be deuiſed, when it will ſerue for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. Correſpondent vnto this ouerſight is that bad conſtruction which you make of my former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but that it ſauoureth a litle more of an vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table minde. In them I gaue you to vnderſtand, that they by whom I paſſed (not all ſorts of people as you report) miſliked much of your rigorous dealing: and therefore deſired you for the loue of our generall cauſe to vſe more mildneſſe. You hereof inferre that I am fallen into temptation, and much changed from that I was. In this your collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I find two faults, the one, in that you inſinuate that then I ſpake <hi>placentia,</hi> but that now I writ <hi>acerba:</hi> There indeed I often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained franckly to ſpeake what I thought, becauſe it was like to do you ſmall good, and more then like to do me much harme, yet I manie times to your ſelfe, and to thoſe who would tel you all, greeuouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of your ſeuere and rigorous kind of carriage towards your countrimen of all ſortes, much vnſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (as me thought) your priuate perſon, more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant from your holy profeſſion, and very ill ſuting,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:9135:75"/> both with the times we liue in, and the parties you haue to deale withall.</p>
            <p>The other fault more fowle in my opinion, is that of a friendlie admonition you gather a falling out: &amp; becauſe I went about to perſwade you, to be more milde, kinde, and curteous, towards your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, who otherwiſe endure ſorrow inough: you iudge me fallen from your friendſhip into a daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation, and to haue incurred many (I know not what) greeuous ſinnes and cenſures, but I am not greatly diſmaid at theſe your bigge words and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying conſequents; when as I finde them to be (as this is) erronious in the light of nature, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euen by the Heathen Philoſophers, who like well, approue, and commend as verie dutifull among deare friends, not onlie exhortations which I then vſed for the loue I bare you, but alſo reprehenſions, which I now come after withall, being therevnto by you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled. I am ſorry to ſee you who haue ſo long liued among ſo many good religious Fathers, ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that pitch of humilitie, &amp; mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to contemne himſelfe and the honors of this world, &amp; to deſire to be euil thought &amp; ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of: that you may not abide to heare tell of any fault of yours, but by &amp; by, you fall out with your friend, for that he in faire tearmes intreateth you, to looke vnto ſuch an euil humor, as partly by naturall inclination, partly by long cuſtome of harkening vnto flatterers, you may be ſubiect vnto. And albeit in another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of yours, you would ſeeme not to miſlike them, who aduertiſe you of that they think amiſſe: yet this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9135:75"/> your euil taking of ſuch aduertiſements when they come, doth euidently proue the contrarie: and this fault is taken to be too common in ſome of your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie; and I my ſelfe once before, found the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour in one of your principall Agents in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:<note place="margin">Theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I was ſo farre off from receiuing a good anſwere (due at leaſt in courteſie for that I deſired it) that my Letters were read openly and ſhewed vnto others, and ſiniſter conſtruction made of them, to procure me euill will and diſcredit. What kinde of religion, ciuilitie, or humanitie may be in ſuch maner of dealing, I can hardly perceiue, and liſt not heere to diſcuſſe, hoping that when you ſhall ſee other men ſcanne, examine, and confute your Letters, as you were woont to do theirs; you will be hereafter more mannerly &amp; milde interpreters, leaſt you otherwiſe hap to meete with the ſame meaſure that you meat to others. Well, let vs goe on.</p>
            <p>You pretend, that you expected to receiue from me louing Letters and much good ſeruice. A great preſumption ſurely of my no ſmall mortification, if you ſpeake vnfainedly. For it were no vulgar vertue for manifolde and manifeſt ſlaunders, calumniari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, impriſonment, and exile, which I receiued there among you: to returne and render commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, congratulations, all ſorts of ſweetneſſe and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies; which neuertheleſſe, you would haue the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9135:76"/> world weene that you attended at my hands. But to ſpeake without gloſing, your owne guiltie conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, tolde you euen before our departure as you ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that you were not like to receiue from mee (whom you knowe to be plaine and round:) any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ordinarie curteſie; ſuch as the loue of God and lawe of charitie bindeth me vnto: the which for thoſe good parts it hath pleaſed God to endowe you with, I will alwaies afforde you in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and more too, when I ſhall perceiue that you eſteeme more of it, and to goe about not in emptie words, but by ſound deedes better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it.</p>
            <p>But not to wander vp and downe after all the particularities of ſuch a long tedious Letter: I will reduce my whole anſwere vnto two points. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhall ſhewe what reaſons mooued my brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to ſend vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and vs to goe thither at their requeſt. In the latter ſhall be declared how we were vſed there; in the one or the other I will anſwere to whatſoeuer in your Letter touching me, and hope by both to giue ful ſatisfaction vnto all honeſt, equal, and vpright conſciences, of that which they haue heard obiected againſt me, concerning that negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The moſt holy and bleſſed courſe, of the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reduction of our Countrey vnto the auncient Catholique faith in Apoſtolique manner, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſomewhat hindered by a diſpute about gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Wisbitch:</hi> and afterwards much more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by emulation, growing betweene ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:9135:76"/> of the Societie, and certaine other Prieſts: who tooke themſelues much impeached in their credit by them: it did not a litle grieue me (who had imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great part of my beſt yeares in that our good Lords harueſt: and had nothing on earth in ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular recommendation, as to ſee that heauenly work proſper) to conſider what impediment and let of it was like to follow, if thoſe ſparkes of diſſention were not ſpeedily quenched. Wherefore, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the auncienteſt ſort, and of better marke, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and affection towards our Countrey, I trauelled about a ſoueraigne medicine, for the preſent mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (as it ſeemed vnto vs) and a notable preſeruatiue againſt any other that might enſue afterwardes; which was to vnite and knit our ſelues together, in ſome louing, ſweete, and eaſie aſſociation and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, that ſo by mutuall intelligence, counſell and ayd, we might either prudently preuent, or ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily meete with all inconueniences that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ariſe among vs: being now many in number, and euery one left vnto his owne gouernment and diſcretion. This matter of vnion was communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto all, and euerie man almoſt requeſted to ioyne in it: a draught of rules were drawne, which were fewe, eaſie, reaſonable, and much profitable: which were alſo ſhewed vnto whoſoeuer would ſee them, that if they miſliked any thing therein, it might be amended, and ſo made agreeable vnto all honeſt deſires. What could in reaſon be more demaunded? Yet, becauſe this proceeded not, as it is thought from the Societie, nor had any dependance vpon
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9135:77"/> them; although at firſt they ſeemed to approoue it much, as that which was in itſelfe, honeſt, iuſt, and neceſſarie: yet afterward ſeeing it likely to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to growe into ſuch a body as theirs is, they openly oppoſed themſelues againſt it, and ſtirred vp their fellowes to contradict and croſſe it, as much as they could: and in the meane ſeaſon coyned a new forme of gouernment or ſubordination (as they call it) neuer heard of in the Church of God ſince the the beginning of the world, vntill our dayes; and by Cardinall <hi>Caietanes</hi> authoritie, cauſed the ſame to be caſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, at vnawares; our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſents or likings neuer demaunded, vntill it was (as they ſaid) eſtabliſhed. This cunning and audacious enterpriſe with the prepoſtorous vnaduiſed proceeding in it: mooued farre greater diſcontentment among vs then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was the principall cauſe of ſending vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> (the ſoueraigne Court of Eccleſiaſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie) that from whence the fountaine of our griefe did ſeeme to ſpring, from thence in like maner we might deriue and drawe the ſtreames of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That we had many waightie, vrgent, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motiues to ſue vnto that Court, a wiſe, vpright, and well practiſed man in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, ſhall (I doubt not) willingly graunt mee after he hath well weighed and pondered theſe reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; which are taken of the order it ſelfe, of the obtaining, ſending, publiſhing, and executing of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, touching this ſubordination, it being no ſuch as our ſauiour Chriſt Ieſus deliuered to his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9135:77"/> Apoſtles, or that hath bene ſeene practiſed in anie part of Chriſtendome theſe 1600. yeares: no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though ſimple witted men, who deſire not to ſtraie from the holie ſteps of our forefathers, were at the firſt not a little amazed at it, and could not be ſo verie eaſilie induced to approue it. This alſo, beſides the noueltie of it, being much more odious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable (as it was then propoſed) then anie other gouernment that our predeceſſors had euer liued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For hauing full and abſolute power to puniſh ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, and that (as it were) at pleaſure and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it had no facultie ioyned with it, or abilitie to benefit or do anie good at all: no not ſo much, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amendment of the partie puniſhed, to reſtore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him againe that hee had taken away from him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If now he haue more ample authoritie, he may thanke our complaints, which were no ſmal cauſe of it. And herevnto his Iniunctions (whereof more in an other place) that Prieſtes ſhould not meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuilie in our countrie; that they ſhould not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlie ſend vnto their friends ouer the ſea: whereas openlie they can doo no ſuch thing, as all the world knoweth; and tell vs (I pray you) when and where euer you heard of ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical gouernment in anie Chriſtian countrie before: that ſacred Prieſts, the free children of God his familie ſo greatlie priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all good Chriſtian Princes, ſhould be (I know not by whom) in ſuch a ſeruile ſort yoaked?</p>
            <p>Againe, this puniſhing authoritie cannot be wel practiſed in England during this heate of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore ſeemed to be fruſtrate and giuen in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:9135:78"/> vaine: for by the Canon lawe (which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule of ſpirituall cauſes) as by all other lawes; no puniſhment ought by ſentence of Iudge to be inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the offender (not confeſſing the action) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be by order of lawe conuicted. Confeſſion of the fault is ſildome in that Court or neuer to be expected: wherefore lawfull defence is to be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto anie perſon accuſed before he be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But no proceſſe according vnto order of lawe can be framed &amp; followed, ſo long as we haue hotte perſecutors, laying waite euerie where to apprehend vs. For to omit all other difficulties (which in practiſe will be founde to be verie manie) where can a ſafe place be found to aſſemble the parties, their witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes &amp; Proctors together; and there to hold as it were an Aſſize, for the determination of their controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which to be neceſſarie, <hi>Lancelot</hi> a man ſingularly ſeene in both lawes and authour of the inſtitutes of the Canon law ſetteth downe (which he taketh out of the Canon lawe, <hi>Extra de appell. cap: ex parte tua:</hi> ſee alſo the gloſſe there: which both require a ſecure place, both for the parties, Proctors, and witneſſes, or elſe holdeth them for excuſed if they appeare not) <hi>Institu.

Now euerie Catholicke knoweth, that there is no place in our Country, free from daunger for Prieſts
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:9135:78"/> to aſſemble together: ſuch diligent watch and ward being laide in euerie ſhire to apprehend them. And who will be ſo ſimple, as to allow them a hall in his houſe for their pleadings, whereby he (that cannot ſtart) doth caſt himſelfe into a hundreth perills, of looſing not onely all his goods and libertie, but his life alſo and inheritance? A place of aſſurance then cannot in theſe times be appointed for the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: hee therefore is warranted by lawe not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, although he be cyted by his lawful magiſtrate. And ſo no action can be commenced, much leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by this authoritie of the Arch-prieſt: and conſequently, ſuch penall power is to ſmall purpoſe in our Country. This ſubordination then being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant without example of antiquitie, hatefull, as hauing power to puniſh, but not to pleaſure; and ſcarcely poſſible to be now practiſed in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, had we not great reaſon to certifie his holineſſe of the inconueniences of it, and in humble ſort to ſue vnto him for remedie and redreſſe, before hee put to his hand vnto the confirmation of it?</p>
            <p>And this you muſt needs much more eaſily grant, if you conſider how this ſubordination was procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and gotten: for it ſeemeth to haue bene by falſe information, which alone is ſufficient to ouerthrow the whole authoritie.

I will not deny, but that ſome one Prieſt, who had bene in England, being then idle in <hi>Rome,</hi> might by euill counſaile and ſubornation take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be ſent of the whole bodie, and ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto conſcience and good order, ſpeake in their names, that neuer ſent him. But what was graunted vpon ſuch vntrue ſuggeſtion, euery man knoweth to be of no force and validitie; and that we in England had iuſt cauſe to certifie his holineſſe, by truſtie meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, how we were greatly abuſed, by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our names, to obtain that exorbita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deuiſe, which we neither deſired nor liked, but rather, that it would pleaſe his holineſſe, to eſtabliſh among vs, that ſound Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy which was inſtituted by the wiſdome of God, &amp; had bin euer ſithence in time of perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as wel as in peace, obſerued in all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Nations: that he would (I mean) giue vs Biſhops the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, and onely ordinary Paſtours of God his Church, who might confirme,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9135:79"/> conſecrate oyles, and bring many other of God his bleſſings among vs. But not to digreſſe from my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>The third cauſe why this ſubordination did miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vs, was for that it came not authentically from his holineſſe, by Bull, Breue, or any other lawfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, but was framed by you <hi>Father</hi> (as it is thought) liked by Cardinall <hi>Caietane,</hi> (a great patron of your plots) and by vertue of his Letters authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſent in amongſt vs. If his L. had beene ſo prouident as he was aduenterous, hee ſhould haue certified vs before, how he came by any ſuch ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne commaundement ouer our Countrey: for that was vtterly vnknowne vnto the moſt of vs. We had heard that he was Protector of our Colledge, and of our Nation in the Citie of <hi>Rome:</hi> but it litle followeth thereof, that he might erect a ſpirituall Monarchy in <hi>England.</hi> For there be in <hi>Rome</hi> many other Protectors of Nations, but yet no one beſides him, that taketh vpon him any ſuch authoritie. But to purge himſelfe from this ſtaine of vſurpation, hee writeth that his holineſſe willed him to take order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs for peace and vnitie. Let vs do him the honour to beleeue him on his word (although ſome report that hee hath little deſerued it at our hands:) was there no other meanes to be found for appeaſing of all parties, then to caſt vpon vs without our priuities and conſents, contrary to the Canons of the Church, a platforme of gouernment, neuer before ſeene or heard of in the Church of God? Would not a man maruell where his Lordſhips
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:9135:80"/> iudgement was, when he approued without any one preſident ſuch nouelties? Surely, their wits ſeeme to haue bene gone on wooll-gathering, that inuented this, as a way of peace and vnion; it being moſt like, what for the ſtraungeneſſe of it, as alſo for the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly obtaining and ſending of it, to engender much more debate amongſt vs then was before. For, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the generall voyce of the wiſeſt Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale men: there is no higher way to diſſention and garboiles, then to bring in (as it were perforce) a new and ſtraunge order of gouernment. But not to omit any thing for his Lordſhips excuſe, he writeth in the ſame his Letters, that his holineſſe liked well of the reaſons exhibited vnto him for that ſubordination: ſo in the ſame ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he ſaith, that we engliſh prieſts preſented many gentle perſwaſions vnto his holines, for the admitting of it, but in this his Lordſhip ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue bin deceiued: why then might he not ſo be in the other? But admit that his holines liked of the reaſons, &amp; that there was no ſurreption: no more followeth, but that his holines would haue the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall prooue how the prieſts in England would like of that ſubbordination, and according as he ſhould heare of their acception, hee would after either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue or diſprooue it. This (at the moſt) to haue beene his holineſſe minde, I heard of a principall Officer of his at <hi>Rome.</hi> Alſo, other honeſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Prieſtes, affirme on their credits, and are ready to binde it with their oathes; that they heard you <hi>Father,</hi> yea and the Pope his Holineſſe himſelfe ſay, that hee would not eſtabliſh and ſet any certaine
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:9135:80"/> ſuperioritie amongſt vs in England; before hee had heard from vs of our good wills and likings, which was fatherlike, louingly, and wiſely ſpoken; confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable vnto the auncient Canons: ſee <hi>diſt. 61. can. nullus inuitis detur Eps.</hi> Let no Biſhop bee giuen to men againſt ther wills: the reaſon he ſetteth down in the lawe: <hi>diſt. 63. can. ſi forte: ne ciuitas</hi> (inuita) <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copum non optatum aut contemnat aut oderit.</hi> Leaſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a Biſhop giuen them againſt their wills, they do either contemne or hate him, whom they deſired not. If ſuch liking and conſent be required by the Lawe for ordinarie Magiſtrates: how much more for extraordinary and ſuch as they neuer heard of before; and that eſpecially at the firſt reducing of them to ſubiection, who before were free from that yoake: when after the gloſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word <hi>Rogarunt: dist. 21. can. In nouo. non niſi volentibus dabitur Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus etiam a Papa.</hi> A Prelate is not to be giuen but to the willing, no not by the Pope: much leſſe of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall. Heere we tooke theſe words of the Canon firſt cited <hi>dist.</hi> 61. to haue place. <hi>Sit facultas Clericis renitendi ſi ſe viderint pregrauari, &amp; quos ſibi ingeri ex tranſuer ſo agnouerint non timeant refutare.</hi> This paſſage falleth ſo fit to our purpoſe, that it ſeemeth to haue beene made for the like caſe. Wee were about a ſweete brotherlike aſſociation, euerie man made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to it, euery ones aduiſe and counſell required and deſired: in the meane ſeaſon to croſſe our good meaning and deſignement for vnitie and concord, a ſtately ſuperioritie is intended vpon vs, whether we will or will not. Who can now condemne vs for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:9135:81"/> taking the benefite of this lawe, which giueth vs as it were commiſſion to reſiſt ſuch intruſion, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs boldly to reiect and refute him that was ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwartly thruſt vpon vs; eſpecially by appeale and recourſe vnto both our ſuperiours, for the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and quietting of all parties? And truly to declare my opinion, who of many haue thought very well of M. <hi>Blackwell,</hi> and euen then wiſhed him greater preferment: he ſurely, if he had harkened vnto his owne naturall diſpoſition and accuſtomed mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and had not bene by ſome haſtie hot-ſpurres pricked forward, would not vpon ſo ſlender a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as a Cardinalls Letter, haue taken vpon him ſo ſtraunge a vocation, againſt the conſents of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his bretheren: ſome his auncients, ſome his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls, many not much his inferiours, in ſtanding, learning, good affection, and merit towards our Countrey: a man of his grauitie and pietie, that had no doubt many times pithily declaimed againſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and deſires of honours, ſhould at leaſt (as mee ſeemeth) ere he had vndertaken that dignitie, haue graunted ſo many graue learned men, leaue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, to informe themſelues throughly of the whole matter, before they did binde themſelues to that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</p>
            <p>But to proceed forward in my proofes, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication and execution of this ſubordination much more yet increaſed our diſlikes, and miniſtred new occaſions to appeale from it. The publiſhing of it, by the Arch-prieſt his owne Letters, ſeemed vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Where were your wiſedomes? Could not a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9135:81"/> Letter at leaſt haue bene deuiſed from the Cardinall (who was ready to aſſigne al that Father <hi>Parſons</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto him) to the Prieſts, aduertiſing them of this his good pleaſure, or ſome other mannerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention haue bene framed; but that the good man himſelfe muſt needs be made his owne Trumpeter and Crier: and be forced to offer that violence to his modeſtie, as to blow abroad &amp; divulgate his late atchieued promotion, and to begge of his fellowes, or commaund them (take of the two whether you thinke more ciuil) to like well of his preferment, and therevnto in all haſte, to ſet to their hands: they muſt not in anie caſe, ſtaie to examine his authoritie, what it was, whence or how it came, but foorthwith put their neckes in the collar, be ſubiect and obay him. This vncomely &amp; vntimely haſte to bind our ſelues, I know not vnto what ſubiection, ſeemed verie raw, and of hard digeſtion: and nothing ſutable with the grauitie and waight of the matter, which required much more mature deliberation.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, when by word of mouth he broached the ſame his authoritie vnto certaine Prieſts, he to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the matter withall, added thervnto ſomewhat of his owne: and being forthwith taken tardie, hee did preſently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that he indeed put therto ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what: as honeſt Prieſts on their oathes will teſtifie. This gaue a great preſumption that the matter was contriued by their friends, and that they might adde or diminiſh at their pleaſure. Which is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if we call to mind and marke what inſtructions he gaue forth at the firſt as receiued from the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9135:82"/> Among others, were theſe, that Prieſts ſhould not meet ſecretly together, that they ſhould not ſend any priuie meſſages ouer the ſeas; that they ſhould take in good part whatſoeuer was either written or ſpoken againſt them, and ſuch like which are not in the rowle of his inſtructions ſent him from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, as euerie bodie may ſee; and I can by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a true copie of them, when need ſhall be, eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrate: and beſides are ſo voide of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo odious and intollerable in our Country, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at this time, when Prieſts cannot meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or do any thing, but in ſecret: that a babe might plainly feele them, neuer to haue proceeded from his holineſſe, or from anie noble, free or compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heart, but to ſauour of (I know not what) baſe minde too too much addicted to terror, crueltie, and ſeruitude. I will (that I be not ouerlong) omit diuers other pregnant &amp; forcible reaſons which we had of ſending vnto <hi>Rome;</hi> this onely I may not leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, which of it ſelfe were a ſufficient cauſe to ſue and ſpeak for redreſſe in ſeaſon: vz. that in the whole drift of this ſubordination, extreame partialitie was apparantly ſhewed, which as the world knoweth, was no good meanes to appeaſe all parties &amp; to ende their debates; the onely cauſe pretended of this late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erected authoritie, &amp; namely to accord the Prieſts and Ieſuites, as the Letters Pattents ſpecifie. Now that controuerſies be wel decided, and all honeſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties agreed, it was meete (perdie) to chooſe vpright and indifferent Iudges and Arbiters, who ſhould without fauour, feare, loue, or hatred, waigh euerie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9135:82"/> mans cauſe vprightly, in the ballance of equitie, and without reſpect of perſons, giue ſentence according to iuſtice. This is a principall in iudgement ſo cleare, by the light of nature, that it is graunted of verie <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans:</hi> yet in our cauſe very badly obſerued: for both the Arch-prieſt and his counſellours, (vnto whom the determination of our cauſes are to be referred) were all choſen by the one partie, with a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſo, that no one be admitted vnto that number, who did not greatly fauour the ſame partie: howe contrary ſoeuer they were vnto the other partie, it imported not: yea perhaps the more earneſtly bent againſt them, the rather elected. Had not trow you, the other poore partie iuſt cauſe to refuſe ſuch Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeres and Iudges that were ſo alienated from them, and ſuch fauourites of the aduerſe partie: and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the vniuſt ſentences that were like to follow of this partialitie, to flie in time for refuge vnto their lawfull ſuperiour? And if in all pettie iudgements, euery priuate man is allowed by lawe an exception againſt a partiall Iudge, how much more is the ſame to be graunted vnto many auncient, graue worthie men, in a generall cauſe of a Country.</p>
            <p>Two proper points of pollicy I obſerue in this election, the one in chooſing the Officers ſo plyant to their pleaſures, that they may be the more readie to runne byaz when it will ſerue their turnes. And yet becauſe men are mutable, to hold them in awe, their authorities might be taken from them, what time ſoeuer the Cardinall thought good, as in the points it is to be ſeene: but let this goe, becauſe I tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:9135:83"/> it before; the other peece of pollicy yet more fine, is, that the Arch-prieſt himſelfe who is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to giue iuſtice vnto both parties, hath power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouer the one partie; &amp; none at all ouer the other: ſo that the one he may by cenſures &amp; ſeuere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſtraine to ſtand to his definitiue ſentence: but the other needs not to care for him any further then that he may vſe him, to plague his aduerſarie. <hi>Vt ſibi caueat loco.</hi> Theſe hardy champions, hold it not ſufficient to haue the fauour of the Court for them: but for feare of after claps, wil haue alſo their perſons exempted from the principal magiſtrate, and reſerue themſelues onely, to their owne Fathers iudgement, which muſt be ſought for alſo, farre inough off from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that in forme of ſupplication, if I miſtake not much the Arch-prieſts inſtructions.</p>
            <p>Here ſeemeth to be the place to anſwere to that ſentence of yours (<hi>Father</hi>), where you tel vs in good ſadneſſe, that many yeares you demaunded with your friends for this ſubordination. I beleeue you ſurely, conſidering that neither you would haue yours comprehended in it, and yet you would haue the appointing of all the Officers, and ordering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all matters belonging to it. But ſay you it was thereby to deliuer the Societie from that calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vſed to be laid againſt them, that they would gouerne the Prieſts againſt theirs wills: and you had ſome reaſon ſo to ſay, if you had ſuffered the Prieſts to haue choſen their gouernours according to their owne wills &amp; deſires: but you putting in, and choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch commaunders, as at your becke, ſhould be
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9135:83"/> readie to doo whatſoeuer you will, doo manifeſtly prooue that ſaying to be no calumniation, but a plaine demonſtration of your incroaching, vpon the gouernments of prieſts, much further then your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or vocation doth require. For by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie courſe of the Church, religious men are to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by ſome of the lay Cleargie, and not the Cleargie by them.</p>
            <p>Well to drawe towards the end of my former part, this ſubordination being both ſtraunge in the Church of God, hatefull of itſelf, and not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in our countrey in theſe times, it being alſo procured (as it ſeemeth) by falſe ſuggeſtion, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by him, that was not knowne to haue any ſuch authoritie, and finally by partiall election of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, tending vnto the oppreſſion of many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perſonages, who had excellently well deſerued of our countrey by their long and fruitfull trauells: yet remaineth euident and moſt manifeſt, that wee had ſundry, iuſt, lawfull and great cauſes in humble ſort to ſue vnto our ſuperiours for a mitigation or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of it, and for eſtabliſhing of ſome better and more fit for our countrey. Whereof appeareth firſt, how vaine that vaunt of yours is, where you ſay, that we came and brought nothing with vs, and that you were aſhamed to ſee that wee had taken ſo long a iourney and had ſo litle to ſay, when beſides the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before mentioned, we had many other points al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of importance in our meſſage. As to deſire and ſue for Biſhops, or at leaſt, that the facultie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and to conſecrate oyles (whereof our countrey
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9135:84"/> ſtandeth in very great need) might be giuen vnto ſome of our auncient Prieſts, with diuers ſuch like, which were not vnknowne vnto you, wherefore I maruell with what conſcience you can ſay, that wee brought no matter of ſubſtance, or worth our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. Secondly, out of the premiſſes followeth, that the loue of God his cauſe, the zeale and earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſome good order for peace &amp; vnitie, mooued mee (at the earneſt requeſt and ſolicitations of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny godly and graue Prieſts) to forgoe the company of my deare friends, to contemne mine owne eaſe and commoditie, and to put my ſelfe vnto the paine, daunger, and part alſo of the coſt of ſuch a long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous iourney: and not ambition, as many of your dependants, haue with euill conſcience bruted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in diuers coaſts, and one of the ſocietie an eſpeciall correſpondent of yours, did not bluſh to write, that we in <hi>Rome</hi> had confeſſed, that nothing but ambition incited vs to this iourney, of which I certified you in my former Letters, and you writ that you cannot beleeue, that any body would giue out any ſuch impudent reports, but I aſſure you that I haue ſeene it written, and can haue their Letters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, when time ſhall ſerue to confront the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſpreaders of ſuch ſlaunderous rumours. And albeit you cleare me of that crime moſt willingly (as you write) yet as men that ſpeake hollowly, and not from the heart, you giue forth ſome ſuſpitions out of other mens ſpeeches, and lay downe in their names, your reaſons for confirmation of them. The firſt is, that in the papers we brought with vs, there were
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:9135:84"/> voyces for our promotion: I anſwere, that with thoſe papers I was not much acquainted, as one that neither gathered them, nor carried them; and full well I knowe and proteſt, that by accord among our ſelues, it was determined before I reſolued to take that iourney, that they which were ſent ſhould not accept of any preferment willingly, although it were offered them, leaſt they ſhould giue their euill wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers occaſion to carpe at them, rather to ſeeke their owne particular, then their generall good. Their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon is, for that in a fooliſh Letter <hi>de preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tijs incerto autore,</hi> a requeſt is made, that wee ſhould bee made not Biſhops onely, but Arch-biſhops (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoothe) and ſuch a ragmans rowle, there is in it, of which is the firſt dignitie after the Biſhop, which is the ſecond, and ſo (as farre as I remember) vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue twentie, that any foole almoſt, may ſee that Letter to haue bin contriued to worke our diſgrace; and ſo as a fiction not worth the anſwering. Their laſt reaſon was, for that in an other Letter of I know not whoſe (the phraſe is) of your L L: for your Lordſhips: but this Letter would neuer be ſhewed (although it were moſt inſtantly deſired) becauſe they ſaid it to be from a very friend of ours, a general anſwer vnto theſe Letters is; that it is eaſie, for thoſe that liſt to deuiſe what Letters wil beſt ſerue for their turnes, and then make great matter out of them. But howſoeuer it were, yea admit that all were true, as they ſay: yet nothing elſe can be prooued out of them, then that many wiſhed and deſired our prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whereof whoſoeuer would gather, that wee
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:9135:85"/> were ambitious and deſirous of honour: I will bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay that his wits begin to faile him, if they euer were good. For the humbleſt men in the world, and thoſe that were fartheſt off from ambition, were euer thought moſt meete, and were moſt deſired to take the charge and dignitie of the beſt ſeates. God make me as free from all vaine deſire of worldly promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as were S. <hi>Barnard,</hi> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine,</hi> and ſuch like moſt learned and vertuous, and withall moſt meeke and humble perſonages: who neuertheleſſe, were greatly deſired, euen of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, to take vpon them great and high dignities. In a word, it was no ambition in vs that others wiſhed and deſired our preferment. And as I afore ſaid, their wits weare apace, and are neare the wane, that of ſo vaine and light ſurmiſes, iudged vs ambitious, and their conſciences fowly cankered and corrupted, who of ſo weake and ſlender preſumptions, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by writing or ſpeaking to impaire our credits, and to hurt our good names.</p>
            <p>Heere I would finiſh this part, but that I take it very expedient and almoſt neceſſarie, to touch by the way (vntill a fit confutation come, which will be ſhortly, if the Author ſuppoſed will auouch it: as one of the beſt of the ſocietie thinketh he will not)<note place="margin">Fa. Maior.</note> to touch I ſay in a word or two, a ſawcie, rude, and vnlearned diſcourſe, intituled <hi>Contra factioſos in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Listers Treatiſe.</note> becauſe the drift of it is, to proue that we were ſo farre off from hauing good cauſe to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> about that matter, that we were all Schiſmatickes, who did not at the firſt ſight of the Cardinalls Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:9135:85"/> receiue the Archprieſt without anie more adoo, &amp; to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted many other enormious crimes. I am ſorie to ſee ſuch a baſe peece of work, &amp; ſo chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhly handled, to proceed from one, who, if hee did not deſpiſe others (that might haue ſometimes bene his good maſters) as Dwarffes in diuinitie, (<hi>Homu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes enim vocat</hi>) &amp; take himſelf to be ſome huge Giant were to bee eſteemed to haue much better skill in ſchoole diuinitie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he at his firſt comming to light amongſt vs hath made ſhewe of. And trulie, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke it to proceed from ſome other not ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a man, and a meaner ſcholler, it is ſo void of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo full of arrogant &amp; approbrious tearmes, and hath ſo many <hi>pergoes</hi> and <hi>properoes,</hi> odde interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and prepoſterous exclamations. All which are nothing vſuall among ſchoole-men. Well, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be, beſides diuiſions, the penalties that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of ſchiſme, and much other impertinent ſtuffe, it hath but one bare ground of that badde aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſeemeth alſo to hang vpon gimballes (as they ſpeake in my Country): for it ſtandeth vpon a proportion or ſimilitude, this it is in forme. That is ſchiſme in the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, which is rebellion in a ciuil Common-weale; but in a ciuil ſtate, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, not to receiue a temporall magiſtrate, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the King, and recommended by his Letters, therfore it was ſchiſme, not to receiue a ſpirituall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, elected by the Pope, and by his Letters ſent vnto vs. This is his argument, in ſubſtance, &amp; framed in as good order as it can be: but it concludeth not, nor prooueth any thing at all: for to ſpeake plainlie,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9135:86"/> all the propoſitions &amp; parts of it be faultie, the <hi>Maior,</hi> or firſt propoſition taken of a ſimilitude is verie fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for <hi>Argumentum a ſimili</hi> (as the learned hold) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis valet ad ornandu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> orationem quam ad aliquid proban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> it ſerueth more properly to trimme vp and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh out a matter that is well prooued, then to be the maine ground of a proofe. So that it was no ſmall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſight in a man of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to laie ſo foule a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his whole diſcourſe. The <hi>Minor</hi> or ſecond propoſition of that argument is apparantly falſe: for in what Countrie I pray you, or by what lawe is it rebellion not to receiue a magiſtrate appointed vnto vs by the King? It may be diſobedience, if they haue not great reaſon to refuſe him: it may bee alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, if it be not done in dutifull ſort, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their bounden dutie vnto their ſoueraigne, and making their recourſe vnto no other but vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for redreſſe and remedie; but to teach it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, where there are no armes borne againſt the Prince, nor no obſtinate deniall of his princely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; is to bring a new doctrine into the world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to both the ſignification of the word rebellion, and vnto the common acception and vſe of it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the learned. Now the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> collected of a feeble <hi>Maior,</hi> &amp; falſe <hi>Minor,</hi> muſt needs be nothing worth: &amp; ſo notwithſtanding that argument, it is no ſchiſme not to haue receiued a magiſtrate nominated &amp; cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the Popes holineſſe Letters; other arguments he bringeth none, but a certaine generall kinde of <hi>Maxime. Qui vos ſpernit me ſpernit,</hi> which was ſpoken vnto the Apoſtles, and may ſerue for ſuch like, to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:9135:86"/> proue no ſchiſme, but a contempt: when without good reaſon, and after an vndutifull manner, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately contemne our ſuperiours. In the allegation alſo of that one Canon <hi>Nulli fas eſt Dist.</hi> 19, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto this trifler often referreth vs. There are 3. foule faults. Firſt it is euil applied vnto a Cardinals Letter, being in the lawe ſet downe for confirmation of the Popes decretall Epiſtles, which as the learned know, are of farre greater authoritie, then his owne ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letters: and doo without all compariſon ſo farre ſurpaſſe a Cardinals <hi>Miſsiue,</hi> that to apply to the one, that which is proper to the other, is litle leſſe then to doate. Secondly that decree is onely againſt Prelates that diſobey the Popes commaundement, which to extend to all ſorts of perſons, is a foule fault in penall lawes, which paſſe not their caſe. Thirdly the decree plainly ſheweth, that in Prelates it is only diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; preſumption, not to obey the Popes decree, and not ſchiſme: for theſe be the words; <hi>Damnatus ſua inobedientia &amp; preſumptione.</hi> If then in theſe his principall forces, he hath ſhewed himſelfe ſo weake, iudge I pray you what worthie ſtuffe the reſt is like to be. But becauſe I heare my brethren endure the contumelie and approbrious name of Schiſmatikes, albeit that they vpon the firſt ſight of his holineſſe confirmation of the Arch-prieſts election, ſubmitted themſelues vnto him: I wil by the proper paſſion and inſeperable qualitie of ſchiſme, proue that our action to haue bene nothing ſchiſmaticall. All ſchiſme (as it is properly taken) is ioyned with ſuch a rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church &amp; chiefe Paſtour of it, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:9135:87"/> his ſubiect obſtinately to contemne his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and to refuſe to ſtand vnto his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and determination.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the words of the Angelicall Doctor, and moſt ſure pillar of ſchoole Diuinitie, S. <hi>Thom. 2. 2. q. 39. ar. 2. Pertinaciter eius preceptum contemnere, &amp; recuſare eius iudicium ſubire.</hi> Marke the words. It is no ſchiſme where there is not contempt of the ſuperiors commaundement, and that obſtinate and wilfull: which is not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man vpon probable reaſon, doth not preſently do that which his ſuperior commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, hoping that when his ſuperior heareth his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hee will not be diſpleaſed with him. This man (as euery man ſeeth) deſpiſeth not his ſuperiour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he may by errour or ignorance perhaps of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, and yet not onlie contempt of the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours commaundement is required to make ſchiſme, but alſo an obſtinate reſolution that he will not (for examining his reaſons, and finall diciſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie) ſtand vnto his ſuperiours iudgement. <hi>Vt cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> recuſat eius iudiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubire.</hi> And that you may know that this is not onely S. <hi>Thomas</hi> opinion, who alone might ſuffice, as being the Prince of ſchoole-men: I will ioyne with him that moſt reuerend, holy, and learned Biſhop of <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, S. Antoninus</hi> the ringleader of caſuiſts, who in his <hi>Sum. P. 3. Tit. 22. c.</hi> 5. § 11. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth the ſame in theſe words. <hi>Schiſmatici ſunt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes reſiſtentes Papae non quocunque modo, ſed per ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am intentionem, &amp; manifeſtam rebellionem &amp; eius iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicialis ſententiae recuſationem non recognoſcendo ipſum vt caput Eccleſiae.</hi> All they are Schiſmatickes, not in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:9135:87"/> what ſort ſoeuer, but ſuch as reſiſt the Pope vpon wilfull intention, and by manifeſt rebellion, and by refuſall of his iudiciall ſentence, in not recogniſing him to bee head of the Church. Of the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>Siluester Verb. Schiſma.</hi> §. 1. to omit all late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: we therefore that delaide to receiue our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, vpon many probable reaſons, the which I haue before rehearſed, and referred our ſelues vnto his holineſſe iudgement, and ſent ſpeedily to giue him to vnderſtand of our difficulties, with humble ſubmiſſion vnto his finall concluſion: cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be prooued Schiſmatickes, or to haue come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing neare that obſtinate contempt, and vtter refuſall of his holineſſe ſentence, which is alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Schiſme, and can neuer be ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it.</p>
            <p>This argument neceſſarily deliuereth vs from the note of Schiſme, although our Arch-prieſt had beene choſen by his holineſſe, and by the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe recommended vnto vs: but when hee was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nominated by ſubdelegation from a Cardinall, who neuer made publickely knowne in England what authoritie he had ouer vs, it had bene great ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, (that I ſay not great folly) to haue admitted of him, without further inquiſition, conſidering all the circumſtances, of the procuring, ſending, &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it, as I haue at large alreadie diſcourſed. Wherefore to conclude this former part, it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rebellion or ſchiſme, as where was not any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate contempt of his holineſſe, or refuſall of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſentence: or any diſobedience, not to haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:9135:88"/> of our Arch-prieſt before he had the Pope his holineſſe Letters in confirmation of his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, no man being bound to receiue him before; both according to the practiſe of the Church in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and conformably to the grounds of the Lawe recorded by that ſingular Canoniſt <hi>Lancelot.

Firſt of fortitude, in reſiſting them that went about wrongfully to oppreſſe vs, and take our priuiledges of electing our gouernours, graunted by the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Canons: then of iuſtice, both in ſuing for our right of chooſing, as alſo in aduertiſing of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſubreption and other inconueniences of that ſubordination. Of temperance, that in ſuch a milde ſort we ſought for a moderation of it, by the way of intreatie and ſupplication, and conſequently ſome part of prudence muſt needs haue bene obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:9135:88"/> in the due exerciſe of the other vertues: yet as I am none of the wiſeſt, ſo I willingly confeſſe now as I did then, with you <hi>Father</hi> (not any errours as you write) but that there was lacke of due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in my fact, as in ſome other circumſtances, ſo eſpecially that paſſing through <hi>Fraunce,</hi> where I might eaſily haue procured the Kings Letters, and thereby haue beene preſerued from all ſudden ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſecret ſhutting vs vp; and ſo haue bene able to come vnto equall triall of our cauſe: I vpon other reaſons omitted ſo to do. This my negligence grew in part, of the ouerweening, I had of their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, charitie and religion, with or againſt whom I had to deale: whom I found (much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie vnto my expectation) ſharply bent vnto warre and hoſtilitie, and vtterly reſolute to take aduiſe of no man; but <hi>omnibus vijs &amp; modis,</hi> as they ſay, determined whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer came of it, to do their owne willes. God graunt them therefore good wills and wayes; and ſo to knit vp this part, all that I haue ſaid concerning the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt &amp; the ſubordination, is not to diſcourage any of my brethren from it, beeing now confirmed by his holineſſe; and for that it is better to raunge our ſelues vnder whatſoeuer order, then to looſe our times about contentions: but (as I ſhewed before) it is to purge and cleare vs from ſundrie falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being therevnto as it were by others enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and to ſhewe what reaſon wee had to doo that which we did.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the latter part, wherein I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to declare how we were vſed there: the which I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:9135:89"/> will do as briefly as I may, becauſe the matter is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and ſcarce worth the hearing, and ſhould for me haue beene buried in obliuion: had not you (<hi>Father</hi>) by miſreport therof vrged me vnto the true narration of it. If in the relation of it, I differ ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from you, you muſt beare with me, for that you diſſent much (by your leaue be it ſpoken) from the veritie of that matter, it may be, you remember not ſo well, what then was done, as we which felt it; <hi>Pium eſt hoc credere,</hi> it is good ſo to thinke, although it be more like, that you being aſhamed to heare what was reported of it, thought it good policie to colour and diſguiſe the matter as much as you could, and much more then you ſhould, to ſaue your credit, with thoſe at leaſt, which take all your words for Oracles; and by the firſt ſetting of it foorth vnder your name, to foreſtall (as it were) and drawe vnto you other ſimple ſoules that are too credulous. Wherefore I am to requeſt all indifferent readers, who hath ſeene yours, not to ſuffer themſelues to be carried away with a ſmoothe tale cunningly tolde them, but they will keepe one eare for vs; and then (laying all affection and partialitie aſide) hauing heard both parties, iudge vprightly as before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, the ſoueraigne and moſt iuſt Iudge. To come then to the matter, I will firſt ſet downe how all things paſſed plainely, and afterwards exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine moſt briefly the iuſtice of it, and ſome points of your narration.</p>
            <p>We comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> about the time you write (for where you tell truth I will agree with you) not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:9135:89"/> willing to acquaint that Courtanie further with the imperfections of our Country then muſt needs, and deſiring rather in faire and friendly ſort, to compoſe matters, then to contend with our brethren, we went the ſame day vnto the Colledge, to open vnto you our good meaning and purpoſe, requeſting you to ioyne with vs, about the contriuing of ſome ſuch lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, reaſonable and indifferent order, as all honeſt parties might be contented, and ſo drawne vnto one ſweete and ſure band of peace &amp; concord. The ſame our intention, we declared ſhortly after vnto both the Cardinalls, Protectors. <hi>Caietan</hi> who was ere we came thither greatly incenſed againſt vs: (God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his ſoule) and <hi>Burgheſio,</hi> whom we found more calme, and deſirous that all our diſputes might be well and quietly ended: you (<hi>Father</hi>) alſo ſeemed at the firſt not vnwilling to hearken vnto that our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for peace: hoping then (belike) to winne vs to whatſoeuer order you ſhould deuiſe &amp; frame: but finding in fewe daies conference that we were reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute not to condiſcend to any thing, that was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, and good generally for one as well as for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: you ſent vs word (much before our daies of hoſpitalitie were accompliſhed) to depart the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge preſently, and to prouide for our ſelues where we could: which we did, keeping fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our lodging; becauſe then we be began to miſdoubt ſome foule play, calling to minde, how rudely you had handled the Schollers &amp; Prieſts alſo before; and ſeeing that in the citie we were then fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red euen of your friends as a ſhrewd buſtling Beare.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:9135:90"/> It fell out euill for vs, that his holineſſe, as then was not there, who returned out of his iourney from <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> but three daies before Chriſtmas, ſo that for the preſſe of great perſonages, who went to welcome him home, and the feſtiual daies following, we could haue no fit audience, till after Chriſtmas: you in the mean ſeaſon not ſparing that high ſolemnitie of our Sauiours birth, contriued our apprehenſion, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by the indiſcretion of one of our friends lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out our lodging, came vpon S. <hi>Thomas</hi> our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons day (to make your celebration of thoſe feaſts) to viſit vs as a good friend, and to aduertiſe vs, that you had heard that it was his holineſſe pleaſure, that we ſhould be reſtrained, but for the loue you bare vs, you were come before in haſte (for you came puffing and blowing vp the ſtaires): what? to aduertiſe vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to looke to our ſelues, &amp; to be gone betime leaſt we ſhould be taken; nothing ſo: but much more like to giue vs a Iudas kiſſe. For you had the Comiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with his miniſters at your taile, &amp; came (for ought I can gheſſe) to leade them to the place, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them out the perſons whom they ſhould take, and leade warily, not vnto the priſon, for there we were like to meete with ordinarie Officers, equall to all but vnto the Colledge, that there being ſhut vp from all helpe, we mightlie whollie at their deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I know (<hi>Father</hi>) that you came thither preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to intreate for vs, that we were not ſent vnto priſon: but that was but for a colour, for that you might haue done as well abſent as preſent. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary being wholly yours, ſet on, lead, and lodged
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:9135:90"/> by you: in the Colledge we were locked vp apart in two litle cloſe Chambers, much more like the worſt then the beſt in the houſe, with poore ſchollers fare, and in ſmoaky coloured gownes, ſuch as the ſeruants weare, farre otherwiſe (<hi>Father</hi>) then you bragge of: for the moſt part kept without fire, being verie cold, and for twentie daies, not ſuffered to goe out, not ſo much as to heare Maſſe vpon New-yeares day, or the Epiphany. Examined we were, by one <hi>Signior Acariſius,</hi> a truſtie friend of yours Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> an humble ſeruant of Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> our potent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary. The examinations were, what is your name, how old, where remained you in England, how and which way came you ouer, what money brought you ouer with you, &amp;c. and much ſuch like imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſtuffe to fil vp the papers, that when we came to the matter it ſelfe they might be briefe: taking bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what we came about, without the reaſons &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of it: yea obiecting againſt it, &amp; peruerting it what they could.</p>
            <p>And becauſe <hi>Signior Acariſius</hi> ſeemed not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſharpe enough; Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelfe would be an examiner alſo: when I heard that Cardinall <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> ſhould be our Iudge, I excepted againſt him, as being one principal partie: but I could not be heard; I called alſo for a Proctor to aſſiſt vs with his counſel: it was denied. NO remedie, for there was no bodie to be ſpoken withall, but Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> and whom hee appointed: we had not ſo much libertie, as one of vs to conferre with another; all our inſtructions were taken from vs alſo, and neither pen or paper, or any
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9135:91"/> booke allowed vs, wherewith we might helpe our ſelues in that our common cauſe, vntil the day of our hearing came, which was a little before Shrouetide in an afternoone, where the Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> and <hi>Burgheſio</hi> being preſent, our examinations were read each mans apart, which ſpent moſt of the time; after a long bill exhibited againſt vs, with ſome Letters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the end of it: and ſo the time was ſpent vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, little examining and waighing the ſubſtantiall points we came about: we were after that kept two moneths cloſe, attending their LL. ſentence, which ſome ten daies after Eaſter was deliuered vnto vs: to this effect eſpecially, that we ſhould goe whither they ſent vs, and not returne into England without expreſſe licenſe. <hi>Propter controuerſias quas cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſui ordinis hominibus exercuerunt,</hi> for maintaining of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with mee of their owne order. This is I aſſure you on the word of a Prieſt, the very truth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>Now touching the equitie of it, let any prudent man, neuer ſo little voide of paſſion, iudge what iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice it was, firſt to haue all our inſtructions &amp; proofes taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs: after to ſeperate vs that we ſhould not one help another; then to keep fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs all learned counſell; laſtly to make our profeſſed aduerſaries our Lawiers, the relaters of our cauſe, and finally our Iudges. I would gladly ſee for the excuſe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (but I ſhould meruaile if any man were able to ſhew) a preſident of ſuch a forme of iuſtice, or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Indeed I muſt needs confeſſe that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Burgheſio</hi> alwaies ſeemed deſirous to haue heard
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:9135:91"/> the matter better ſifted and diſcuſſed; but being <hi>punye</hi> and the other ſo exceedingly bent againſt vs, hee could doo nothing for vs. Now concerning the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall point of our reſtraint, I could neuer get them to tell me, ſome reaſonable cauſe, why we Chatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Prieſts, that had ſo long laboured with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of our liues, for the Catholique cauſe, and then ſuing in humble and dutifull ſort vnto the Court; ſhould be caſt in priſon, before we were conuicted, or lawfully accuſed of any crime. I demaunded of the Confeſſor, that ſometimes viſited me, he could tell none, although he lacked not skill in caſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but referred me vnto the Comiſſarie. I asked him, hee would giue mee no other anſwere, then that it was his holineſſe pleaſure: you (<hi>Father</hi>) goe about to ſhewe the reaſon why his Holineſſe would haue it ſo: but with ſuch a circuite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that it is hard to picke out what you would ſay, that it was, becauſe we oppoſed our ſelues, and not tarrying to bring any matter of ſubſtance againſt his gouernment, &amp;c. What matter we had againſt that gouernment, hath bene before declared, and the reaſon why we ſtayed no longer, was that we might come to ſhewe our griefes before his holineſſe had confirmed him. For it is to be vnderſtood, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the election of ſuch a high Officer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, there is a certaine pawſe made, to heare whether any thing will be obiected againſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or concerning that point of office; that in ſeaſon conuenient remedie be prouided, and the perſon elected if he do intermeddle in his charge, before he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:9135:92"/> bee confirmed, is preſently to be depriued of all that intereſt which was giuen him by the election; which if our Arch-prieſt had looked into, hee would not haue bene ſo haſtie, as to haue dealt in that charge, before he had receiued his Letters of confirmation; but you ſay at laſt, that his holineſſe caſt vs in priſon, becauſe wee ſubtracted our ſelues from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Arch-prieſt, and gaue other men occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do the like.</p>
            <p>I denie now as I did vnto you then, that I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted my ſelfe from his obedience, either therefore ſet downe, wherein by word or deed, I with drew my ſelfe from his obedience, or elſe let the world take you for an egregious calumniatur. For I was with the Arch-prieſt before I went, and tolde him of my iourney, and gaue him the cauſe of it in writing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my hand, taking alſo a copie of it vnder his hand; and he neuer commaunded me not to goe, neither in any other point did I tranſgreſſe any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. What an irreligious and damnable ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then was that inuented of purpoſe, to haue vs taken and ſhut vp before we were heard: that they might haue the deliuerie of our meſſage, and be our Interpreters and Proctors, and ſo make vs ſay what they liſted, and our matter to be ſuch as they would haue it. But ſay you. Did you not come to <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? There was no diſobedience in our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſue vnto our ſuperiour, for it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable vnto the Canons and practiſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, and was not, nor could not haue bene forbidden by him: See, <hi>Nauer. cap. 23. Num.</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:9135:92"/> 37. The ſubordination indeed did not like me, for the cauſes aboue mentioned: yet I carried my ſelfe ſo warily, that I did nothing againſt it, but ſought or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly vnto my ſuperiours, in time and place to haue it amended, which is very lawfull; yea if he had bene an Arch-biſhop, and muſt needs haue bin graunted by lawe, if we had had our Courts of lawe as in other Countries they haue: if any were ſcandalized at this our orderly repaire vnto our ordinarie ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, let the wiſe iudge whether it were <hi>Scandalum datum</hi> or <hi>acceptum.</hi> I ſhould now according to the order I propoſed, examine and confute, ſundrie falſe calumniations, which you let fall by the way; as that we depoſed we had nothing elſe to ſay, and that wee could not name a dozen Prieſts for vs, and as your followers amplifying, ſuch flying tales reported, wee had not halfe a dozen that gaue vs their ſuffrages, when we had twentie nine in writing with vs, ſome of them ſpeaking alſo for others, and yet neither ſought for many, nor ſtaide about that matter, but contenting our ſelues with ſome of the moſt aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt, moſt learned and of beſt reputation in our Countrey: truſted to the waight of reaſon, which we had on our ſide, and to the equitie of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, before whom we went to preſent our ſelues. Againe, how ridiculous was it to expect of them that are to be ſo narrowly ſearched when they paſſe out of the Countrey, that they bring their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with them in great ſheetes of paper, as though the vertue of witneſſes lay in the bigneſſe of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that we ſhould haue brought ſome Princes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:9135:93"/> Letters patents with a broad Seale at them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the magiſtrates are our enemies. Theſe and many ſuch like I will leape ouer, that I may at length come to an end; and if my Letter ſeeme long, let the blame be imputed vnto yours, which, in anſwere to halfe a dozen lines, grew into two ſheetes of paper and a halfe: if it be thought too ſharp, let it be well waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether men firſt hardly vſed in fact, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by wordes and Letters much damnified in their credits, haue not iuſt cauſe to write roundly: and if you like not to be ſo freely reprehended, be not ſo lauiſh of your penne, for vnleſſe my foreſight faile me, you are like hereafter to be no more ſpared of many then you ſpare others. Wherefore to drawe vnto a concluſion, apply to your ſelfe ſome part of the good counſell you gaue me in the latter end of yours, haue patience with whatſoeuer falleth out, and perſwade your ſelfe that he which offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth many, is ſure to be offended by many: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holding your ſelfe within the bounds of your religion, meddle with other mens matters as litle as you may; and if for the common good of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey you pleaſe to be doing, take rather the way of mildeneſſe which winneth mens hearts, then of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour which lightly offendeth all. Follow the noble, prudent, and admirable ſteps of that rare ornament of our countrey, and ſingular light of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> who carried himſelfe ſo courteouſly towards all men, ſo charitably and withall ſo wiſely, that he was able to haue done with vs Prieſts what he would moſt eaſily; and did hold
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:9135:93"/> the Laie Gentlemen in ſuch a reuerend and louing awe, that albeit ſome of them were verie prone to contentions &amp; quarels, yet his authoritie and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile ſo brideled and raigned all exorbitant humors, that in his time, to his perpetuall praiſe, no great flames of diſſention burſt out, eſpecially amongſt vs Prieſts, when you taking the contrary courſe of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, haue made an open breach amongſt vs alreadie, and God knoweth what may fall out heereafter, if you looke not vnto it in time, which becauſe you are wiſe, I hope you wil do, and ſo ſhall you purchaſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelfe much more good will and quietneſſe in this life, and better aſſurance (if I be not farre decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) of euerlaſting repoſe, &amp; ioy in the life to come, the which with all my heart I wiſh you; and ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly commending my ſelfe vnto you, </p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ell, well, Fa. <hi>Parſons,</hi> I pray God ſend you a more ſincere and quiet ſpirit. I finde that true daily more and more, which ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue heard good Cardinal <hi>Allein,</hi> Father <hi>Holt,</hi> and others of your owne coate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of you, that you were a man of too violent and hard a nature. It were high time that you ſhould permit your ſelfe &amp; vs, to carrie our gray haires in peace to our graues. The trouble and ſcandall you haue wrought in our Church theſe late yeares by your polliticke courſes, doo quite cancell all your former deſert. Was our peace and vnion made at the comming of his holines Breue, and the moſt iniurious calumnie of ſchiſme and enormious diſobedience to the See Apoſtolicke, raiſed and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued moſt preſumptuouſly againſt vs &amp; our ghoſtly children by your ſocietie here, to the greeuous ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of our whole Nation: was it, I ſaie, put vp by vs, and for loue of peace and vnion forgiuen; that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after we had receiued the authoritie, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted our ſelues to it, you, and yours might more ſafely and liberally renew the infamie againſt vs, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:9135:94"/> by the Arch-prieſtes authoritie (aſſured to you in whatſoeuer you liſted to attempt againſt any) at your pleaſures perſecute and oppreſſe vs? You haue in the higheſt degree, diſhonored &amp; iniured <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, whiles by your cunning you ſo enormiouſlie abuſed our bretheren (as good doubtleſſe as your ſelfe) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing and comming in all humble &amp; dutiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Apoſtolicke See; defaming them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting his Ho. minde from them, as from vile and badde perſons, by your vntrue reports before they came; and procuring (a moſt impious and horrible thing to be recounted for perpetuall, yet hateful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, of your fact) them to be impriſoned as noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious malefactors, before they had bene heard, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp all meanes of acceſſe to his holines, and your ſelfe playing their Iaylour, a fit office doubtleſſe for ſo well diſpoſed a religious perſon, and finally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their hard baniſhment, to no leſſe diſhonour to the See Apoſtolicke, (abuſed by your informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) then to your owne perpetuall ignominie. And whiles you haue done all this by abuſe of the ſupreame authoritie, through your vnconſcionable and vntrue informations: you giue all our Nation here cauſe enough, neuer to admire or hereafter to exclaime againſt the iniquitie of aduerſaries, who may truly iuſtifie themſelues in their hard procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings againſt vs, by theſe vnconſcionable courſes of yours. A lamentable caſe, that now by the polliticke ſhifts of one perſon of religious profeſſion, orderly appealing to S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, muſt be thought a treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and puniſhed as a greeuous crime. Our ſtatute
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:9135:95"/> of Premunire may well be repealed now: Father <hi>Parſons</hi> a Ieſuite, hath laid a plot ſufficient enough to hinder appellation or acceſſe to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Is it poſſible this iniquitie of yours ſhould be kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from the world? Is it poſſible his holineſſe and the gratious Cardinalls you haue ſo notably abuſed, ſhould neuer be brought to knowe the innocencie of vs whom you haue thus wronged and perſecuted in our bretheren, and neuer can ceaſe to afflict? Will they neuer, thinke you, finde out your deceit, and by iuſt diſcuſſion of our cauſe, relieue our miſeries, and repay you your deſerts? The clamours of innocent men, will in time no doubt, aſcend vp to heauen, and wee cannot but hope that our Lord Ieſu (whoſe worke we haue in hand, and whoſe glorie wee ſeeke with innumerable vexations for his ſake) will once ſtirre vp and direct his Vicar, to iudge and diſcerne our cauſe, and to deliuer vs from your moſt violent and wrongfull oppreſſions. In the ende it will be found we were no Schiſmatickes, nor in the leaſt point that may bee deuiſed by an vnconſcionable head, diſobedient to his holineſſe, or any ſuperiour he hath or ſhall appoint ouer vs. I am perſwaded ſurely, that God will haue you and your adherents knowne ere it be long.

This would not be graunted by you and yours, but for our good endeuours, they take from vs our faculties (I might haue ſaid you take) whereby we liue; we wiſh rather you had at once taken from vs our liues, but we take it to be Gods prouidence, that enforced to come to buckle with you once againe before S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, we may cleare our ſelues, and diſcypher what your ſelfe, M. <hi>Haddock,</hi> and others of you are: for better, or leſſe euill it is, you ſuffer as you haue deſerued, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the See Apoſtolicke be abuſed and deluded by you, or our afflicted Church be thus exceedingly diſturbed by men that are fledde from the worke and campe of Gods ſouldiers, and ſome of you, of no great edifying conuerſation whiles they were among vs. Moſt glad we would be (God is our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) if we might on all ſides be at peace and ſincere friendſhip one with an other: but if you will not permit this, Gods will be done: we muſt defend our good names, and our childrens, as deare vnto vs as our liues; in which the moſt of vs I hope, finde no ſuch ſweeteneſſe (how pleaſantly ſoeuer you and yours liue) among theſe innumerable aduerſities, as we can deſire or delight to keepe them, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famies you haue moſt vncharitably and vniuſtly laid vpon vs. We impute no fault nor blame to his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or his Cardinalls, in beleeuing your falſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations againſt vs, till wee come to ſpeake for our
