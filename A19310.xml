            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Other ≈øome, (who perceiue well, that, if this ≈øhould be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be the true cau≈øe of ≈øo ≈øcandalous a ≈øchi≈øme in Gods church, it would redound to the eternall di≈øgrace, &amp; infamie of ≈øuch, as, by whom they hauing conceiued ≈øome fooli≈øh hope of preferment, they had rather that they ≈øhould indeed beare the ≈øway, &amp; haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Cleargie (although it were vnderhand) then be ≈øaid either to ≈øeeke it, or to haue it) giue out that the cau≈øe of this diui≈øion among the Prie≈øts is, for that ≈øome Priests mooued either with ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, or de≈øire of contradiction, will not ≈øubiect them≈øelues vnto their lawfull ≈øuperiour appointed by his holine≈ø≈øe, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in authoritie ouer them by his Breue ≈øent into England for that purpo≈øe: and the≈øe haue from time to time both written, and maintained in mo≈øt iniurious manner (to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe the more perfectly ≈øuch as are too readie to thinke no calumniation too greeuous euen again≈øt tho≈øe who haue be≈øt de≈øerued of them) that the≈øe Priests are ≈øchi≈ømatickes, ≈øeditious, rebellious, &amp;c. euen to the diuiding for this cau≈øe of parents and their children, men and their wiues, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ≈øi≈øters, and whole hou≈øholds, while the one retaining that reuerend respect of their long knowne, and tried ghostly fathers, for learning, wi≈øedome, and vertue, is a≈ø≈øailed by the other with the≈øe most wicked ≈øuggestions, and fal≈øe calumniations, and forced either to liue a di≈øcontented life, or to break friend≈øhip; and (again≈øt their owne con≈øciences) make ≈øemblance at the lea≈øt that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hardly of ≈øuch as they very well per≈øwade them≈øelues wil not

            <p>That therefore no errour be hereafter in any man, who will not too much affect ignorance in ≈øuch things as concerne not onely his particular good but the Common cau≈øe of God, &amp; his Church (which whiles the Cleargie liueth at ≈øome variance in an euill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Countrey, cannot doubtle≈ø≈øe but be very greatly preiudiced therby) it is thought expedient, yea nece≈ø≈øarie, that the cau≈øe of this di≈ø≈øentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> be with truth, and ≈øinceritie declared, &amp; made knowne to the world, that our actions and the rea≈øons thereof being weighed with equall ballances, truth may take place, the offerers of the wrong may be di≈øcouered, the vniu≈øtly afflicted may be relieued, and that ea≈øe (at the lea≈øt by the≈øe meanes) may be procured, which would not come of ≈øo long ≈øufferance.</p>
            <p>The ≈øtrife, and di≈ø≈øention at this day too great, and ≈øcandalous in England, is maintained by the Arch-prie≈øt, the Ie≈øuites, &amp; their adherents, again≈øt tho≈øe Prie≈øts who did forbeare to ≈øubiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues vnto the Arch-prie≈øt con≈øtituted in authoritie ouer all the Seminary Prie≈øts in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> by a Cardinall, who was Protector of the Engli≈øh Colledge at <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards honoured with the title of Protector of <hi>England,</hi> for the which forbearing to ≈øubiect them≈øelues at the fir≈øt making knowne of this authoritie, the Prie≈øts were accu≈øed of ≈øchi≈øme, ≈øedition, faction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, &amp;c. All which calumniations were forgiuen by the Prie≈øts ≈øo grieuou≈øly iniuried, and a peace made to the great comfort of all Catholiques, when his holine≈ø≈øe Breue was pre≈øented vnto them, but this peace was ≈øoone after broken by the meanes of the Ie≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, who reuiued the ≈øame calumniations again≈øt the Prie≈øts, and by the Arch-prie≈øt, who did not onely auerre the a≈ø≈øertions of the Ie≈øuites, but publi≈øhed al≈øo that he had receiued a re≈øolution from the mother Citie (to v≈øe his tearmes) which avowed that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øers of the authoritie (noting by this phra≈øe the Prie≈øts who did forbeare for a time vpon cau≈øes ≈øeeming iu≈øt to them to accept thereof) were Schi≈ømatickes. So that the cau≈øe of this diui≈øion now in England, is not for any re≈øistance in the Prie≈øts again≈øt the
<pb facs="tcp:9135:4"/> ≈øuperioritie, as many forward and euill taught people per≈øwade them≈øelues, &amp; cry out again≈øt the prie≈øts, that they are di≈øobedient. But the cau≈øe of this diui≈øion is, for that the Prie≈øts will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that in the time of their forbearance to ≈øub≈øcribe to the authoritie (which was no longer then vntill they ≈øawe the Breue) they were factious, ≈øeditious, rebellious, Schi≈ømatickes, enormiou≈øly di≈øobedient, in continuall mortall ≈øinne, practi≈øing their function in irregularitie, and pretending to ab≈øolue from ≈øinne without facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or iuri≈ødiction meete therevnto, wor≈øe then South-≈øayers and Idolaters, &amp;c. If therefore ≈øufficient rea≈øons may be giuen why the Prie≈øts did forbeare to ≈øubiect them≈øelues before they ≈øawe any Letters from his holine≈ø≈øe concerning this authoritie, it will both appeare how greatly they haue bene iniuried both by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie≈øt, Ie≈øuites, and their euill nurtured children, and how nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie this cour≈øe of publi≈øhing in this ≈øort, is for the purging of the other Prie≈øts from tho≈øe ≈ølaunderous ≈øpeeches; and here by the way do we aske of tho≈øe pious Catholiques, (for ≈øo they mu≈øt be tearmed how≈øoeuer they de≈øerue it,) when they charge, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade them≈øelues that they choake the Prie≈øts with di≈øobedience, what it is, that they meane by this di≈øobedience, if they meane ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that the Prie≈øts do not acknowledge M. <hi>Black.</hi> for their Arch-prie≈øt and ≈øuperiour, they may if it ≈øo plea≈øe them correct this their vnderstanding, and from henceforth either beleeue that euery man dooth acknowledge him, or el≈øe name who doth not, and let him in particular be called in question for it: for this generall prattle that they are di≈øobedient is ≈øo vn≈øauourie a ≈øhift, vnle≈ø≈øe they could di≈øcend to particulars, that a man with litle honestie would quickly perceiue how it doth taint his breath:</p>
            <p>If by di≈øobedience in the Prie≈øts they do meane the not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or conforming their vnder≈øtanding to the Arch-prie≈øt his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding, they exact this obedience to the Arch-prie≈øt either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that he is learned, or becau≈øe that he is a ≈øuperiour, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the≈øe respects conuince any ≈øuch matter, as that the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to be ≈øo conformable ≈øhould bring with it ≈øchi≈øme, ≈øedition, fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rebellion, &amp;c. Not the fir≈øt, which is in regard of his learning. For although that many in England for modestie ≈øake onely make

The progre≈ø≈øe of the matter you ≈øhall vnder≈øtand as occa≈øion ≈øerueth. In the end of your Letter, you make mention of a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion lately growne among≈øt vs, who ≈øhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of loue and vnion, and laments the bitter fruites ≈øprung thereof, as pernicious to many a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian ≈øoule. Whereof diuers friends of mine by name are charged to be ≈øome cau≈øe, for that they were not ready at fir≈øt to yeeld to the late authoritie of Mai≈øter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> nor as yet can be brought to acknowledge the ≈øame. Truly Syr, for that you are my friend, and I throughly acquainted with the origine &amp; proce≈ø≈øe of the difference, I thought it my part, for your better information, &amp; di≈øcharge of my blamele≈ø≈øe friends, briefly to ≈øet downe what is done in this matter, and vpon what ground, and then to leaue the cen≈øure of it to your prudent con≈øideration.</p>
            <p>To build ≈øure, I lay this foundation; that it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pietie nor true obedience, at the fir≈øt ≈øight to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any authoritie but ≈øuch as is orderly procured, and lawfully promulgated, in ≈øuch ≈øort that ≈øubiects

Here hence followeth; that which true prudence and vertue doo dictate: that when any new and extraordinary authoritie is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed, they whom it concerneth; before that by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance they approue it, ≈øhould of dutie looke and examine whether it be accompanied with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions aboue mentioned, and ≈øo admit or reiect it, as di≈øcretion &amp; con≈øcience ≈øhall require. To the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, in both the≈øe conditions of lawfull authoritie, this we ≈øpeake of is feared to hault, and not without great pre≈øumption. And for that to handle both at large would exceed the limits of a Letter; and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in either, doth ≈øufficiently warrant their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, I wil leaue the fir≈øt, (for that mu≈øt needs touch particular per≈øons and their actions: which without further occa≈øion and very iu≈øt, I am loath to do) and ≈øhew briefly how the manner of promulgation is in no way ≈øufficient, but rather full of ≈øu≈øpition, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth iu≈øt occa≈øion of di≈øtru≈øt.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt the credit of this promulgation, dooth wholly hang vpon their credits, who taketh autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie vpon them, who for that they are parties in this action, may iu≈øtly be ≈øu≈øpected as partiall in their owne cau≈øe, which cannot choo≈øe but leaue the matter doubtfull in any indifferent mind: or ≈øuch at lea≈øt as no man is in con≈øcience bounde to beleeue.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9135:10"/> Againe, put ca≈øe they were lawfulll promulgators, yet they bring nothing ≈øufficient to ordaine ≈øuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie or iuri≈ødiction: to erect ≈øuch an authoritie, cannot be le≈ø≈øe then an expre≈ø≈øe commaundent of his Holine≈ø≈øe: and giuen for this particular purpo≈øe. And the ≈øame al≈øo authentically notified of al which the aduer≈øe part ≈øheweth nothing, for neither do they challenge any ≈øuch expre≈ø≈øe decree from his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe: but onely order giuen to the Cardinal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, to take vp our controuer≈øies and iarres here, which is nothing to build ≈øuch an extraordinary ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie vpon: or if they did, we are not to giue full credit to the Cardinall his bare word, in a matter of ≈øo great weight: ≈øeeing that in ≈øuch bu≈øine≈ø≈øe he hath heretofore bene founde ouermuch affected to the one part, who haue their finger and hand in the≈øe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and for this rea≈øon hath bene excepted again≈øt as vnfit to iudge in ≈øuch cau≈øes, that ≈øo neare concern tho≈øe parties as the≈øe things do, therefore the≈øe men demaund but right, if they require an authenticall in≈øtrument from his holines to ≈øpecifie his will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and in the meane while determine nothing, but re≈øt ready to imbrace what≈øoeuer his holines ≈øhal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there are now 8. or 9. moneths pa≈øt, ≈øith fir≈øt the authoritie was diuulged, &amp; ≈øithence the lawfulnes therof, for the rea≈øons aboue mentioned and diuers others was doubted of, as not proceeding from his holines: yet the maintainers notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hotte, eager, &amp; earne≈øt cour≈øe that they take in defence of it, would neuer obtaine the lea≈øt ticket,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9135:11"/> or te≈øtimony vnder his holine≈ø≈øe hand, or directly from him, in confirmation of it: nor yet to notefie that euer any ≈øuche matter was appointed by him; knowing that ≈øuch a note woulde haue ended the whole controuer≈øie. And this maketh men in their mindes to que≈øtion with them≈øelues in this ≈øort: doo not the≈øe men by ordinary cour≈øe, monethly or oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner receiue Letters from <hi>Rome?</hi> hath not Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> weekely, yea daily acce≈ø≈øe to his holine≈ø≈øe as other Cardinalls haue? doo they want fauour with him who is wholly theirs; or his forwardnes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that him≈øelfe hath either begunne or followed; and for the credit whereof, hee hath graunted what Letters them≈øelues would reque≈øt, and as effectuall as them≈øelues could drawe them? or would his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe refu≈øe to te≈øtifie that he is the appointer of this authoritie if it had proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> him? No, no, there is cunning ≈øome where, which when matters are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered will quickly appeare. And this is confirmed with another pre≈øumption of no le≈ø≈øe moment then the former. For when the≈øe friends of mine by vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme con≈øent of many of their owne brethren, wi≈øe and learned, &amp; the aunciente≈øt, had re≈øolued peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly to ≈øend ouer to knowe the Popes plea≈øure in this matter, they ≈øent to the contrary part, to intreat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to haue ≈øo much patience as to expect what an≈øwere the≈øe me≈ø≈øengers did receiue from his holine≈ø≈øe: and if matters proued to be ≈øo as they ≈øaid they were, then without further re≈øi≈øtance, euery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ready to ioyne with them, &amp; to re≈øi≈øt who≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ≈øhould re≈øi≈øt them: and ≈øo the whole matter

            <p>But this ≈øo rea≈øonable a reque≈øt could not be heard, but as if they had feared ≈øome pre≈øent daunger now after ≈øending, they po≈øted about more earne≈øtly then euer before, ≈øend abroad papers, threaten excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, promi≈øe fauours, abu≈øe the laitie with infamous reports of their brethren, ≈øending into all quarters of the countrey to begge hands and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcriptions: and where any for what iu≈øt cau≈øe ≈øoeuer did refu≈øe, their meanes open or ≈øecret were deui≈øed to ≈øupplant and di≈øgrace them, and accu≈øations for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to withdraw their lay friends, and con≈øequently their maintenance from them. Which mu≈øt needes con≈øtraine the wronged to defend and cleare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues euen with the ≈øame lay-friends; &amp; ≈øo the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grew to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tention, &amp; became publikely knowne amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g the Laitie, that women &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> do tattle and de≈øcant euery where, and pa≈ø≈øe their cen≈øure therof.

            <p>But what good I pray you did the≈øe men pretend by ≈øo hurtfull a cour≈øe? Was the Pope ≈øo de≈øirous of thankes that it mu≈øt be procured with ≈øuch broyles? I cannot thinke it.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ery Reuerend Syr, As from my very cradle I acknowledge my ≈øelf many wayes beholding vnto you, for your manifold courte≈øies, both towards me and other of my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt friends; ≈øo haue I had alwaies a ≈øpeciall de≈øire, to yeeld ≈øuch corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpondence in my demeanour, as I might neither giue you, nor any other of my friends, iu≈øt occa≈øion to withdraw from me their friendly affection. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthele≈ø≈øe I gather by ≈øome ≈øpeeches that pa≈ø≈øed not long ≈øince, betweene you and a friend of yours and mine, that you haue conceiued a wor≈øe opinion of mee, then wittingly I haue de≈øerued, or willingly would de≈øerue. The ≈øini≈øter reports of ≈øome, who≈øe endeuours are different from their profe≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, hauing cau≈øed in you, not onely a ≈øurmi≈øe, but as it ≈øeemeth, a ≈øtrong and firme opinion, that I am di≈øobedient to the See Apo≈øtolicke, and enemy to the Fathers of the ≈øocietie, and a contemner of the late authoritie of our Arch-prie≈øt. The≈øe be the crymes wherewith I ≈øuppo≈øe, both my ≈øelfe and diuers others are taxed, (or truer) mo≈øt iniuriou≈øly ≈ølaundered. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very vnwilling to permit you to remaine in that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9135:14"/> opinion grounded vpon mere fictions and fal≈øities, I determined to make mine Apologie with you, and to yeeld you rea≈øon for all my proceedings in the≈øe matters: which being weighed in the equal ballance of your indifferent iudgement, I nothing doubt but it will yeeld you full ≈øatisfaction, and giue you ≈øome light to ≈øee how you haue hitherto beene abu≈øed by fal≈øe informers. I know it to be a difficult thing ≈øo to take away and remoue, out of a mature minde, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which hath long without contradiction po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed it, ≈øo to take it away I ≈øay, as there remaine no ≈øcruple nor doubt thereof. Yet when I doo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider on the one ≈øide, your graue and ≈øincere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, voyd (as I verily thinke) of all partialitie: and on the other ≈øide, the clearene≈ø≈øe and manife≈øt truth of the matter I am to ≈øpeake of; I cannot almo≈øt doubt but ≈øo to ≈øatisfie the≈øe obiected crimes, as that you will ea≈øily ≈øee, both my ≈øelfe and others, to haue ≈øuffered mightie wrong by the rai≈øers thereof.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore good ≈øir, craue onely this of you, that you will not mea≈øure that which I ≈øhall ≈øay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preiudiciall opinion which you haue already framed of my per≈øon; for ≈øo ≈øhall you ea≈øily preiudice the equitie of my Plea: but let your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceed of the thing it ≈øelfe, without re≈øpect either to my per≈øon or any other, and ≈øo being voyd of affection, ≈øhall it bee more free from errour. If I ≈øay any thing that may leane vppon humaine creditte as matters of narration or fact, I de≈øire to bee beleeued no further, then I can manife≈øtly proue.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9135:14"/> If I vtter matters of opinion or iudgement, as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or rea≈øons for any fact, I de≈øire no more, then that they be mea≈øured according to the weight and truth they do containe. This is ≈øo indifferent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that if I ≈øhould doubt the graunting thereof, I ≈øhould in mine opinion, offer you no ≈ømall wrong. I will therefore Sir, deteine you no longer with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable circuits of wordes, but I will come to the matter: and what≈øoeuer I ≈øhall ≈øay in mine owne behalfe in this affaire, you may vnder≈øtand it of others that bee of the ≈øame opinion with mee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>The former accu≈øations, to weete, that I am di≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the ≈øee Apo≈øtolicke, an aduer≈øary to the Fathers, and an impugner of our Arch-prie≈øts autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, are all grounded vpon one and the ≈øelfe-≈øame foundation; which I thinke, I ≈øhall ea≈øily ≈øhewe to be both friuolous and fal≈øe, and con≈øequently ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe what≈øoeuer is built therevpon: how≈øoeuer ≈øome men do labour to fortifie the ≈øame, not by the probabilitie of any rea≈øon, or equall debating the matter, but by confidence, or rather impudent infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of ≈øuch as labour to defend the truth.</p>
            <p>All the≈øe accu≈øations therfore are forged vpon this one principle, becau≈øe for≈øoothe I did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge M. <hi>Blackwells</hi> authoritie vpon the receit onely of Cardinall <hi>Caietaines</hi> Letters: wherein he affirmed that the Pope had giuen vnto him, authoritie to appoint a gouernment ouer the Seminary Prie≈øts in <hi>England.</hi> For this cau≈øe I am ≈øaide to re≈øi≈øt the Popes authoritie: and becau≈øe the Ie≈øuites were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9135:15"/> the procurers of this delegation, therfore am I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their aduer≈øary, becau≈øe I did not accept of the thing and meanes to e≈øtabli≈øh it, which they thought good of: And la≈øtly, becau≈øe I did not acknowledge M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> for my Eccle≈øia≈øticall ≈øuperiour, vpon the forementioned te≈øtimonie, I am ≈øaid to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugner of his authoritie.</p>
            <p>Loe Syr, here is the whole ground of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer accu≈øations, neither doo I thinke they laie any thing el≈øe to my charge: If they doo, when I may know it, I will either ≈øatisfie their obiections, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my fault and errour. In the mean while, I would to God that they who do accu≈øe me of the≈øe or what≈øoeuer crimes, would ≈øtand to the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any indifferent Iudge: ≈øuch a Iudge I meane as hath intere≈øt neither in them, nor in me: that his ≈øentence might be voide of all partialitie; mo≈øt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would I binde my ≈øelfe to the iudgement of ≈øuch a one, and if I were conuicted, I would make ≈øuch ≈øatisfaction, as the ≈øame Iudge ≈øhould pre≈øcribe. But I know it is not the gui≈øe of mine aduer≈øaries to admit any ≈øuch tryall; for vnle≈ø≈øe they may be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øers, informers, and Iudges too, they will ≈øtand to no arbitrement. Wherefore to omit this indifferent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, becau≈øe I am in di≈øpaire to obtaine the grant thereof, I will by ≈øhewing mine owne innocencie, make plaine what open iniurie and apparant wrong is offered me.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt accu≈øation wherevpon the other do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and therefore that an≈øwered, the other mu≈øt needs al≈øo be ≈øatisfied, hath ≈øo ≈ømall proofe or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9135:15"/> in it, as I cannot but wonder how any man of indifferent iudgement, vnder≈øtanding the ≈øtate of the matter, ≈øhould be induced to conforme his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thervnto. For to di≈øobey, is to re≈øi≈øt, contemne, or impugne the knowne commaund of a ≈øuperiour. To be a ≈øchi≈ømatique, is wilfully to deuide him≈øelfe from the vnitie of the head as head; or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the bodie, as ≈øubordinate to the head of gods Church. The≈øe propo≈øitions are of them≈øelues eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: but if any doubt of them, let him looke. S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> touching the fir≈øt. 22. <hi>q. 104. ar.</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>q. 105. per to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Touching the ≈øecond, 22. <hi>q. 39. ar.</hi> 1. and <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, ibidem.</hi> The≈øe principles being admitted, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that any ≈øcholler, though but meanely learned, ≈øhould per≈øwade him≈øelfe, that I did either di≈øobey the Popes holine≈ø≈øe, or incurre any ≈øchi≈ømaticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, by not admitting M. <hi>Blackwells</hi> authoritie, vpon the onely te≈øtimonie of Cardinall <hi>Caietanes</hi> Letters. But I perceiue there is no paradox ≈øo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that will not finde ≈øome approuers. I ≈øay therefore, that his holine≈ø≈øe will, was not ≈øufficiently notified by tho≈øe Letters, to make the refu≈øall of the ordinances conteined therein, either di≈øobedience or ≈øchi≈øme, which I prooue by manifold examples. Put the ca≈øe therefore, that ≈øome one of our Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie here in England, ≈øhould addre≈ø≈øe his Letters into Ireland, or ≈øome place of England furthe≈øt di≈øtant from the Princes abode, in which Letters he ≈øhould ≈øignifie, that he had receiued authoritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øtie, to ordaine and e≈øtabli≈øh in that Country, what gouernment he thinketh be≈øt, and together, ≈øpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9135:16"/> ≈øuch a gouernment, as was neuer heard of in that Countrey, or any other, and this without any other te≈øtimony or proofe of his authority, be≈øides his own Letters.</p>
            <p>This ca≈øe being thus put mo≈øt like vnto ours (≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely that ≈øome circum≈øtances are omitted for breuities ≈øake, that make more for our aduantage) I would demaund of the≈øe that accu≈øe me and my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren of ≈øchi≈øme, what the≈øe ≈øubiects ought to doo in this ca≈øe. If they ≈øay that they ought to obey the Noble mans writ, and to admit ≈øuch a Magi≈øtrate as hee dooth appoint them, how di≈øcommodious ≈øoeuer it ≈øeemeth to their Common wealth, and how di≈øagreeing ≈øoeuer it bee from the forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of their knowne Prince: they will binde them to ≈øo many and imminent inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ueniences, that in truth I thinke they wil not auouch ≈øuch an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability. For fir≈øt this would be to enforce them to incurre euident daunger of rebellion towards their knowne Prince, by admitting an v≈øurper: for it may be, notwith≈øtanding his owne word, that he hath no ≈øuch authoritie: yea though the Prince ≈øhould truly giue vnto him that authority, yet the ≈øubiects hauing no other notice of it but only his own Letters and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony, they ≈øhould be ≈øo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> rebelling again≈øt their Prince by deferring to admit his ordinances, till they had more perfect intelligence of theyr Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will; that they ≈øhould be accounted both pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and loyall for ≈øo dooing: and for the contrary, they ≈øhould worthily be condemned of fooli≈øh leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if not of open con≈øpiracie.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:9135:16"/>
            <p>For if they ≈øhould bee called to account, and bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by who≈øe authoritie or commaundement they changed their gouernment, wil any man thinke it ≈øhoulde bee a ≈øufficient warrant, to ≈øay by ≈øuch a Lords Letters, ≈øpecifying no other te≈øtimony of his authoritie, but his owne? I cannot thinke that any woulde beleeue that aun≈øwere ≈øufficient to excu≈øe them, at lea≈øt from ≈øu≈øpition of di≈øloyaltie, ≈øeeing in this ca≈øe, they ≈øhould be no more excu≈øeable, though he had true authoritie, then if he had none at all.</p>
            <p>An other inconuenience which the≈øe ≈øubiects ≈øhould infallibly run into is, that hereby they ≈øhould open the way to euery ambitious or ≈øeditious per≈øon to chalenge the ≈øame priuiledge, to haue his owne te≈øtimony admitted, when≈øoeuer he ≈øhould ≈øay, hee hath authoritie from the Prince, to ordaine what he li≈øt. Which who ≈øeeth not what a heape of inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences it bringeth with it; and the≈øe not following chance or accident; but out of the very nature of the thing it ≈øelfe, ≈øuppo≈øing the corruption of humaine frailtie, which no man can take away: which mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs al≈øo do nece≈ø≈øarily follow vpon the admi≈ø≈øion of ≈øuch a pretended authoritie for the time onely, vntil better certainty may be procured, either for the e≈øtabli≈øhing or reiecting of the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>But if they ≈øay, that the≈øe ≈øubiects ought to reiect this obtruded and vncertaine authoritie, as a thing voyd of all lawful and cu≈øtomary proceeding in ≈øuch affaires, &amp; not without great probability of fraud and euident ≈øu≈øpition of ≈øurreption, they ≈øhal ≈øpeak more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>formably to rea≈øon, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon ≈øence, &amp; practice, both in ciuill and eccle≈øia≈øticall gouernment.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9135:17"/> But if they will auoid both the≈øe extreames (wherof the latter without all compari≈øon is more ≈øecure, and doubtle≈ø≈øe of it ≈øelfe mo≈øt lawfull) and ≈øay that the≈øe ≈øubiects ought at lea≈øt not ab≈øolutely to deny the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of his authoritie, but to delaie till more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit notice be giuen. If, I ≈øay, they affirme this, we will yeeld it vnto them; yea, and that the ≈øaide ≈øubiects, which is much more, are bound of their owne co≈øt and labours, to ≈øeeke the further knowledge of their Princes will: and then I demaund of them what of all this, I &amp; my brethren haue offended, whereby we ≈øhuld de≈øerue the note of ≈øchi≈ømatiques, rebels, ≈øedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious per≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, or the like Epithetons, which they mo≈øt prodigally be≈øtow vpon vs. But if they can neither proue nor yet ≈øhew any di≈øparitie in the ca≈øe, which of it ≈øelfe ≈øeemeth to be too too cleare, I cannot tell how they will auoide the fowle note of ≈ølaunderers and detractours, who haue by word and writing, in England, Flaunders, Italy; &amp; where el≈øe they come, accu≈øed vs of ≈øchi≈øme, rebellion, ≈øedition, and the like.</p>
            <p>Two di≈øparities, peraduenture, they will alledge in the ca≈øe: Fir≈øt, that I put the ca≈øe in ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereas it ought to be in Eccle≈øia≈øticall. The ≈øecond, that I put the ca≈øe in one that is not knowne to haue any ordinary authoritie in the≈øe affaires, whereas it is contrary in our ca≈øe, the Cardinall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Protector of our Nation. But both the≈øe are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ≈øeely ≈øhifts, not worthie of any an≈øwere. For fir≈øt the inconueniences that do follow in the ca≈øe before propo≈øed, doo follow by ≈øo much more euidently in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9135:17"/> Eccle≈øia≈øticall gouernment, by howe much more large the precincts of the Popes iuri≈ødiction are, and further from the place of his abode, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any one temporal Prince, and by how much le≈ø≈øe ≈øen≈øible ordinarily, and more ≈øpirituall Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticall puni≈øhment is, then is the temporall, for ≈øuch v≈øurpers. The ≈øecond is as friuolous; for albeit Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Caietaine</hi> was our Protectour, and al≈øo Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet is it euident, that by neither of the≈øe offices, hee had any ordinary Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øticall iuri≈ødiction ouer our Cleargie, e≈øpecially to erect any new gouernment: and therefore if hee had any authoritie in this matter, it mu≈øt needs be deligate and extraordinary: and con≈øequently, was as well to notifie vnto vs the ≈øame, by ≈øome ≈øufficient te≈øtimonie be≈øides his owne word, as the Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of England is to ≈øhewe his warrant, if he intend to take vpon him the office of the high Martiall, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other not perteining to the Chauncellour≈øhip.</p>
            <p>But they wil further obiect, that to deny or doubt of that which the Cardinall affirmeth, is to call his credit into que≈øtion, who≈øe authoritie ought to be ≈øufficient te≈øtimonie for what≈øoeuer hee ≈øaith: this is their maine obiection, and as it were their <hi>Achilles,</hi> whereby they would prooue vs all ≈øci≈ømatiques. But fir≈øt this argument concludeth not. For ≈øuppo≈øe that we did offend in not admitting nor beleeuing his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony for the in≈øtituting of this new authoritie, yet it followeth not that we ≈øhould therfore be ≈øchi≈øma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, but at the mo≈øt, that we ≈øinned again≈øt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine credit, which cannot be ≈øchi≈øme, as by it ≈øelfe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9135:18"/> is verie euident. But that we neither offend in this manner, it ≈øhall appeare by the two la≈øt an≈øweres to this obiection; and that we committed not any act of di≈øobedience, by denying to obey the Cardinalls ordinances, it is verie cleare: for it is a farre different thing for any one to deny obedience to him whom he knoweth or beleeueth to be his ≈øuperiour, and to deny it to him whom he probably thinketh is not his ≈øuperiour, e≈øpecially if he do it therefore onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he thinketh him not to bee his ≈øuperiour; of which two, onely the fir≈øt is properly di≈øobedience: the ≈øecond is neither di≈øobedience nor any other ≈øin, if it proceed of an opinion as probable, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable then the contrary, much le≈ø≈øe when it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of certaine truth as in our ca≈øe.</p>
            <p>Secondly I ≈øay, that they mu≈øt al≈øo an≈øwere this obiection, if they admit the ca≈øe put before: for if we were bounde to obey Cardinall <hi>Caietaines</hi> ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon his owne Letters onely, then ≈øhould the ≈øubiects before mentioned, be bound to do the ≈øame in that ca≈øe, and ≈øo ≈øhould follow all the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences mentioned.</p>
            <p>Thirdly I ≈øay, that it is not any offence to denie that vnto any one, that is not due vnto him; but it cannot be due vnto any man thogh in neuer ≈øo great honour, to haue his owne te≈øtimony admitted for the acknowledging of that authoritie which he hath not of him≈øelfe but from an other, for otherwi≈øe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in honour might chalenge the ≈øame, and ≈øo bring confu≈øion in all gouernments.</p>
            <p>Fourthly I ≈øay, that the authoritie whereby an act of publicke office is practi≈øed in any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9135:18"/> either ciuil or Eccle≈øia≈øticall, requireth a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall or iuridicall proofe, to make it authenticall. Which kind of proofe or te≈øtimonie, is not required in any other humaine action; for we ≈øee that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimonie of an ordinarie per≈øon may be ≈øufficient for the Iudge, with helpe of other ≈øtrong coniectures, to pronounce a partie guiltie or vnguiltie: and yet the Iudge him≈øelfe mu≈øt ≈øhewe other warrant for his authoritie then his owne word, or el≈øe his ≈øentence cannot binde, thorow default of the vncertaintie of his iuri≈ødiction, though he be otherwi≈øe of neuer ≈øo great honour: neither is this any di≈øparagement to his credit, the nature and ≈øtate of the thing requiring it. The like is in all other actions of publique autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as it is manife≈øt by all experience. For albeit, to conuince a man of trea≈øon or fellonie, is a greater matter in it ≈øelfe, then it is for one to prooue that hee hath the authoritie of a Iudge, or of any other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke officer, yet the te≈øtimonie of priuate per≈øons, though otherwi≈øe of ≈ømall e≈øtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, ≈øerueth for that, and the Princes ≈øeale onely ≈øufficeth for the other. Which is not to be imputed to the credit of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties te≈øtifying, but to the condition of the thing te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for which cau≈øe it is verie ab≈øurd, to ≈øay that the te≈øtimonie of any man though of neuer ≈øo great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is ≈øufficient in his owne cau≈øe to make proofe of the authoritie he claimeth, without concurrance of any other te≈øtimonie; for it is but his owne word, albeit his word would be abundantly ≈øufficient for the proofe of any other humaine matter, as one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe. For ≈øeeing that no man of him≈øelfe, I meane of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9135:19"/> his own per≈øon, hath anie iuri≈ødiction ouer an other: if anie man chalenge it, he mu≈øt either ≈øhewe how he hath it, or el≈øe the other is not bound to beleeue him. As for example, <hi>Peter</hi> is no more bound to beleeue, that <hi>Iohn</hi> is his ≈øuperiour, then <hi>Iohn</hi> is to beleeue, that <hi>Peter</hi> is his; vnle≈ø≈øe the one can ≈øhew it by ≈øome ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe be≈øides his owne te≈øtimonie, for in that they are not much different, although they differ in wealth or honour: which things authoritie, dooth not con≈øequently follow. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>clude this point, I ≈øay, if the Cardinall had giuen his word or Letters in te≈øtimonie of anie truth, not involuing the v≈øe of authoritie, his te≈øtimonie would haue bene admitted without all exception; wherby it appeareth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was not want of due credit that hindred the admitting of his te≈øtimonie in our bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, but becau≈øe the nature of the thing it ≈øelf required other proofe: neither can our aduer≈øaries be ignorant of this, but that they are di≈øpo≈øed to contend without matter: for tho≈øe that will not denie the Sunne to be vp at noone day, cannot denie or doubt of this.</p>
            <p>And thus reuerend Sir, you ≈øee, that conteining our ≈øpeech within the compa≈ø≈øe that the verie ≈øtate and condition of the thing requireth, how farre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection hath ledde them beyond all ≈øence &amp; rea≈øon, that haue condemned their bretheren of horrible ≈øchi≈øme, where there is not ≈øo much, as any litle ≈øhew or probabilitie thereof; though we do con≈øider the matter in all rigour, ab≈øtracting from all circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which being verie many and euident for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, make the thing more plaine and cleare. As

            <p>Notwith≈øtanding the≈øe rea≈øons, and many moe which we had, not onely to deferre, but al≈øo vtterly to reiect this di≈øorderly procured gouernment: you ≈øhall now heare how peaceably and orderly we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the matter; and contrariwi≈øe, how turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and without all ≈øhewe of equitie, our aduer≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries dealt with vs. Which becau≈øe it requireth onely a narration of the≈øe things that haue actually pa≈ø≈øed betweene vs; I ≈øhall not need to alleadge any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon by way of argument to conuince that which I ≈øhall ≈øay, but onely if any thing be denied, to call the world for a witne≈ø≈øe of the truth. Neuerthele≈ø≈øe I do not intend to rippe vp the matter from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for ≈øo I ≈øhould weary you with too long a ≈øpeech: but omitting the maner of proceeding v≈øed in the fir≈øt procuring of this late ordeined gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was very exorbitant, and altogether di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonant to rea≈øon, and the accu≈øtomed practi≈øe of Gods Church in ≈øuch affaires. I will begin with the fir≈øt receiuing of Cardinall <hi>Caietaines</hi> Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we had fir≈øt notice of this authoritie, and ≈øo chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate ≈øome chiefe occurrents that haue actually happened among vs ≈øince that time, whereby you ≈øhall ea≈øily ≈øee, whether we haue offered or ≈øuffered wrong.</p>
            <p>Vpon the fir≈øt receit therefore of the Protectors Letters, after due con≈øideration of the tenour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9135:20"/> becau≈øe they conteined an ordinance vnheard of before in the Church of God, and that without any authoritie from his holine≈ø≈øe, contrary to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall cu≈øtome and practi≈øe of that See. Wherevpon grew many doubts whether that proceeded from his holine≈ø≈øe commaund or no; but that which mo≈øt of all moued, was becau≈øe there appeared no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie that it proceeded from him truly informed of the ≈øtate and condition of our Countrey and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; neither the thing it ≈øelfe, nor the maner of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, yeelding any probabilitie of ≈øuch informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: wherevpon we thought it altogether repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Eccle≈øia≈øticall di≈øcipline and gouernment, to admit any ≈øuch ordinances intangled with ≈øo many doubts.

And M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> him≈øelfe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding his former prohibition (by their ≈øugge≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is more then probable) writ, that they had receiued a re≈øolution from the mother Citie, that we

Will any man now ≈øay, that the≈øe men de≈øire and ≈øeeke the peace &amp; tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of our afflicted Chuch? Can any one bee ≈øo ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe as to avowe it? No, no. When therefore we perceiued our late compo≈øed peace, contrary to all expectation to be thus quickly broken, and that our good names began to bleed afre≈øh, the old gaules beeing not yet firmly cured: we reque≈øted of our Arch-prie≈øt that we might haue a parley or confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vpon the matters in controuer≈øie, with the≈øe conditions.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, that the Vmperes or Arbitrators, to heare or determine of the weight, truth, and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all that ≈øhould be ≈øaid or alledged by either ≈øide, ≈øhould be 2. or 3. of the ≈øeniour A≈ø≈øi≈øtants, and M. <hi>Doleman,</hi> and that it ≈øhould be in the choi≈øe of our Arch-prie≈øt, to admit ≈øuch of the Laitie to be hearers of the di≈øpute, as to his wi≈øedome for the qualitie of the conference, ≈øhould ≈øeeme meete.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:9135:23"/>
            <p>Fourthly, that each of the Arbitrators, ≈øhould faithfully promi≈øe in the word of a Prie≈øt, to proceed to the giuing of ≈øentence vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the proofe or di≈øproofe of either ≈øide, according to the <hi>dictamen</hi> of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, and inward per≈øwa≈øion, without delay, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, mittigation, or partialitie.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that if the ≈øaid Arbitrators, ≈øhould iudge that our ca≈øe was ≈øchi≈øme, and our ≈øelues ≈øchi≈øma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, then we mo≈øt humbly ≈øhould aske pardon on our knees of our Arch-prie≈øt and the ≈øocietie, for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto defending the contrary again≈øt the veritie of their affirmances. If of the other ≈øide, they ≈øhould cen≈øure or deeme that we were no ≈øchi≈ømatikes; then the ≈øocietie, e≈øpecially the penner and the approuers of the Pamphlet of ≈øchi≈øme, ≈øhould acknowledge their errour, reuer≈øe the tract, and make vs ≈øome ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ≈øatisfaction to the heape of iniuries &amp; infamies ≈øu≈øtained.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that it ≈øhould be lawfull without offence or prohibition, for either ≈øide after ≈øentence giuen and fulfilling of the premi≈ø≈øes, to ≈øeeke, if it ≈øhould ≈øo plea≈øe, a re≈øolution in the difference, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øities beyond the ≈øeas, vpon ≈øhewe &amp; euidence of the ≈øaid di≈øpute, grounds, rea≈øons, proofes, &amp; arguments ≈øub≈øcribed, with the hands of the Vmperes &amp; di≈øpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of both ≈øides, to the end it might manife≈øtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be the ≈øame, and no place left to the other ≈øide to ≈øu≈øpect any indirect dealing, either by adding, changing, or ≈øubtracting ought, too or from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; and that none of the fore≈øaid Arbitrators or di≈øputants, refu≈øe or deferre to put too his name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reque≈øted therevnto.</p>

            <p>Could you, good ≈øir, deui≈øe more equall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then the≈øe? Or if the≈øe men did not intend to maintaine continuall brawles and ≈øtrifes, would they not haue admitted them? there being no more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meanes to end all controuer≈øies.

            <p>Finding therfore our ≈øelues in the≈øe mi≈øeries, that we mu≈øt either loo≈øe our good names, or by aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to defend them, incurre ≈øome high di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, we ≈øet downe the ≈øtate of the controuer≈øie, and ≈øent it to the Doctours of the famous Vniuer≈øitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> reque≈øting their opinion and cen≈øure therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p>By the≈øe and the like violent dealings, both in the≈øe matters and others, wherof, be≈øide my ≈øelfe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9135:26"/> haue ta≈øted abundantly; they haue giuen too too pregnant proofes of their further de≈øignements, if ≈øo that they can effect their purpo≈øe. For if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the manifold troubles of the≈øe times, they haue attempted &amp; put in practi≈øe ≈øuch violent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, tru≈øting to their owne power, and not to any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quille: what will they not attempt, or what may we not expect, if future times and other opportunities be an≈øwerable to their de≈øires? Which de≈øires, if they be to Gods greater glory, &amp; more to the good of his Church, with my whole heart I wi≈øh they may take effect, &amp; that they may con≈øummate what they haue begunne. But verily their proceedings haue hitherto bene farre different, not onely from theirs who haue planted and watered the vineyard of Gods Church from the beginning, but al≈øo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> theirs to whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other men, we ought mo≈øt to attribute that hope we haue of the recouery of our poore Country to the Catholicke faith; namely Cardinall <hi>Allane,</hi> of mo≈øt holie and happie memorie, who≈øe life if it had plea≈øed God to haue lent vs till this day, we ≈øhould haue had, if not in ≈øome ≈øort, a flouri≈øhing Church, yet a Church at lea≈øt without ≈øuch enormous di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øtrife, and debate; a Church full of true ≈øimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, religious zeale, and fraternall charitie; for ≈øuch a one (God concurring to his holy endeuours) hee planted, and vntill his dying day, kept &amp; con≈øerued. Notwith≈øtanding tho≈øe who do now ≈øo greeuou≈øly perturbe our peace, did attempt the ≈øame euen in his dayes, but their endeuours being preuented by his prudence, tooke ≈ømall effect ≈øo long as he liued. But
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9135:26"/> alas, ≈øince his too timely death and departure, what mi≈øerie hath found vs, and what trouble hath fallen vpon vs? God pardon the cau≈øers thereof, and grant vs perfect peace and brotherly charitie: <hi>Vt omnes cogno≈øcant qu√≤d di≈øcipuli Christi ≈øimus.</hi> That all men may know vs to be the di≈øciples of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Thus good Syr, haue I laid downe vnto you the whole grounds of the crimes, wherof both my ≈øelfe and diuers others of our brethren are accu≈øed. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>referre the matter to your iudgement, to di≈øcerne whether we be guiltie of them or no. If you doubt of the truth of my relation, I de≈øire none other triall then the te≈øtimonie of mine accu≈øers; who if they denie any one word that I haue vttered by way of narration, I can ea≈øily procure ≈øuch proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as they ≈øhall not denie, vnle≈ø≈øe they will denie them≈øelues.

            <p>Wherefore according to the≈øe grounds, I humbly be≈øeech you to pa≈ø≈øe your opinion, and yeeld your iudgement of our cau≈øe. And if the grounds prooue true, your iudgement conformable therevnto, may remaine firme: but if they prooue otherwi≈øe, your iudgement notwith≈øtanding ≈øhall not be faultie; for he that iudgeth according to his euidence, is not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9135:27"/> of any errour.

But our aduer≈øaries purpo≈øe not to put the matter to any indifferent tryall, or to ende it by any equall meanes, but to decide it by ≈øtrong hand, might, and violence; by perpetuall oppre≈ø≈øing vs with infamous ≈ølaunders of ≈øchi≈øme, faction, and the like; thereby to depriue, if it can be, our brethren abroad, of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient entertainment, and to debarre vs in pri≈øon of nece≈ø≈øary reliefe, to the ende that nece≈ø≈øitie may compell vs to yeeld to their de≈øires: the inequalitie of which proceedings, I be≈øeech you with indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

            <p>If any one to whom you ≈øhall thinke good to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this (as I am not again≈øt the imparting it to any, ≈øo that you keepe the originall your ≈øelfe) ≈øhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to improue me of any vntruth: I will either ≈øatisfie his obiections euen to your own iudgement,

            <p>Take this, good Sir, for a ta≈øte of our internall and dome≈øticall troubles, wherewith I imagine you are not much acquainted, and therefore are you wor≈øe affected to our cau≈øe: and as you ≈øhall giue me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after occa≈øion, you ≈øhall vnder≈øtand more; for this is but a ≈ømall thing in re≈øpect of that which this matter affordeth.

What M.

            <p>Many things doth F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> heape together in this 12.

Fourthly, that they ≈øhould keepe their chiefe me≈ø≈øage to them≈øelues. Fiftly, that they ≈øaid their fill of the Arch-prie≈øt, and Ie≈øuites, and were willed vpon their oathes to ≈øay more.

            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:9135:56"/>
            <p>To the fir≈øt it is well knowne, they had many things to deale in of more importance then are as yet graunted, as the procuring of ordinary Pa≈øtors in Gods Church, or at the lea≈øtwi≈øe, authoritie for the admini≈øtration of the Sacrament of confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øarie in time of per≈øecution, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vaine, and as a ≈øuperfluous ceremonie in Gods Church) 2. The procuring ≈øome meanes for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyles, which v≈øed to come very late to their hands. 3. For the acquietting of ≈øuch ≈øtirres as were then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, and were likely (as the euent proueth) to growe daily to the vndoing of our Countrey, and ≈øuch like. And if F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> had thought what would haue followed in the 17. Paragraffe, he would (as I thinke, vnle≈ø≈øe he were exceedingly ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe) haue had more regard what words he had v≈øed in this 12. Paragraffe; for if that be true, which he there relateth to haue bene depo≈øed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Cardinall and hee had more rea≈øon to be a≈øhamed of that which was brought again≈øt the Arch-prie≈øt, a creature of their owne, then that the two Prie≈øts had litle to ≈øay.</p>
            <p>But if F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> ≈øhould be demaunded where this ≈øhame came vpon the two Cardinalls, or how they came to haue that conceit, that the two Prie≈øts had come ≈øo long a iourney with litle to ≈øay; would he trowe you without blu≈øhing make an an≈øwere? The fir≈øt time that the two Prie≈øts ≈øawe the Cardinall <hi>Burghe≈øe,</hi> and at his importunate reque≈øt, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him ≈øome part of their bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, they found him ≈øo fauourable vnto them, that according to their humble ≈øute, hee promi≈øed that he would procure
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9135:57"/> them audience, before they ≈øhould be iudged, and further them what he could. The fir≈øt time likewi≈øe that they ≈øawe the Cardinall <hi>Caietan,</hi> although he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed them in very rough tearmes, hee willed them to bring in writing vnto him, what they had to ≈øay, and tolde them, that he would thereon con≈øider. And at the≈øe meetings could neither of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals be a≈øhamed of that, which the Prie≈øts had to ≈øay, for neither of them knew but in generall termes ≈øome part of their bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and appointed therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a farther conference. The ≈øecond time that the≈øe two Prie≈øts ≈øawe the≈øe two Cardinalls, was at their arraignment, where the Cardinals might perchance be a≈øhamed of the in≈øolencie of their aduer≈øaries, but could not be a≈øhamed that the two Prie≈øts had litle to ≈øay; for when they were both together, and might haue dealt in their bu≈øine≈ø≈øe (although with this ≈øhamefull di≈øaduantage, that they had all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings taken from them ≈øeuen weekes before, and all that while kept clo≈øe pri≈øoners, that they might not ≈øpeake either each with other, or any body el≈øe (as they did both de≈øire) to aske ≈øome coun≈øel being thus betraied) they dealt as farre forth as was conuenient for them to deale, that is to ≈øay, for ≈øo much as they were at that time vrged to deale in, which was vpon occa≈øion of a Libell put vp again≈øt them by M. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Haddocke,</hi> and M. <hi>Martin Array,</hi> a couple of Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for the Arch-prie≈øt: for when this Libell was read, they offered to make their an≈øwere vnto it, and for that end they demaunded a copie thereof, which at Doctor <hi>Haddocks</hi> earne≈øt reque≈øt, (who Proctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9135:57"/> before had put it vp again≈øt them) was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them; ≈øo that at this time the Cardinals had more cau≈øe to be a≈øhamed of the two Proctors then of the two Prie≈øts, who were arraigned, and by all likelihood were ≈øo, for they di≈ømi≈ø≈øed the two Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and afterward acquiting the two Prie≈øts from all matters except one, that was, that by their going to <hi>Rome</hi> many Prie≈øts and Lay-men in England were ≈øcandalized, they di≈ømi≈ø≈øed them al≈øo in verie friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, and no ca≈øe was alledged of their farther impri≈øonment, but an ouer-great forwardnes in the one again≈øt the Libell, which is an argument that the two Prie≈øts had ≈øomewhat to ≈øay, which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls not being ouer-forward to heare (as it ≈øhould ≈øeeme by their not deliuering the Libell to the two Prie≈øts when they called for it) could not in rea≈øon be ≈øaid to be a≈øhamed that the Prie≈øts had litle to ≈øay. The third time, that the≈øe two Prie≈øtes did ≈øee the Cardinalls, was when they went (as they were ≈øet at libertie) fir≈øt the one, then the other to take their leaues, and ≈øo to depart to the place of their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at which time al≈øo the Cardinalls might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance make ≈øome reflection, but not vpon a thing worthie of ≈øhame in the two Prie≈øts, who during the time that they might deale, alwaies offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, and performed as much as laie in them, and when they could not deale therein (being ioyned ≈øo as the one without the other had not to attempt any thing) they patiently ≈øuffered fir≈øt clo≈øe impri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for 14. weekes with the appurtenances, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a moneths ea≈øier impri≈øonment, and la≈øtly, a

And how≈øoeuer he might forget any other matter, mu≈øt needs remember, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Libell to make their an≈øwere to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the courage of the one in this very action was pretended by the Ie≈øuites, to haue bin the cau≈øe why they were not the ≈øame night ≈øet at libertie, becau≈øe for≈øooth this was an argument to the Cardinals that he was of a ≈øtirring ≈øpirit, and therefore they would for 2. or 3. dayes longer keepe them both in pri≈øon.</p>
            <p>To the ≈øecond, they brought many Letters, from many, as F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> and the Proctors in their moodes will confe≈ø≈øe, although not from any ≈øetled commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie vnder any head, for from this the Prie≈øts refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vntill they had ≈øent vnto his holine≈ø≈øe, which while≈øt they were effecting by common ≈øuffradge (as became Prie≈øts) a head was mo≈øt fraudulently by the Ie≈øuites procured to curbe them, and cro≈ø≈øe them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9135:58"/> in their cour≈øes, which they had intended. And if F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> had remembred, that not long after in the 21. paragraffe he telleth them, that they brought certain notes about their me≈ø≈øage from a principall man of theyr ≈øide of his owne hande writing, yet there to bee ≈øeene, what≈øoeuer hee had written heere of a communitie, hee would not haue ≈øaide that they brought no letters of credence from any priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon; but F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> would perchance giue men to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand, that the petitions of Prie≈øts ≈øub≈øcribed with their owne hands, were not of ≈øo great credence as a brazen face of a Ie≈øuite (who before his holines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that he was a ≈øecular Prie≈øt, and ≈øent by them in their bu≈øine≈ø≈øe) beeing ≈øeconded with as fal≈øe a friend to the Prie≈øts as F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> him≈øelfe a Ie≈øuite in his owne likene≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>To the third, if there were ≈øecret memorialls of mo≈øt ≈øecret bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, how was all ≈øaide by the two Prie≈øts that they could ≈øay? How can the≈øe memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls be termed by F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> to be ≈øecret, if nothing were concealed which was contained in them? and for their weight, if F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> ≈øay true in the 17. para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe, they had no need to be of greater weight then the re≈øt, for F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> there confe≈ø≈øeth that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie≈øt was touched, yea in the verie matter of his faith, for that an hereticall propo≈øition was laide to his charge, as appeareth by their papers, and depo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions yet extant, which would hardly be excu≈øed, if ≈øuch a thing ≈øhould be prooued again≈øt one, who to giue him what F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> giueth him (no doubt great commendations) is a man of tho≈øe parts, and merits,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9135:59"/> that all Engli≈øh men doo know, or at the lea≈øt might imagine ≈øo long as he did not ≈øhew him≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>To the fourth, I know not what was their chiefe me≈ø≈øage, nor where they had any conuenient time or place to vtter it, or any other, being clapped vp clo≈øe pri≈øoners before they came to doo any thing, and neuer after ≈øuffered to be together at libertie in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the fift, a rea≈øon is giuen before, why it was no wi≈øedome for them to ≈øay their fill, either of the one, or the other, being in cu≈øtodie of the one, who was the more carefull of his charge in re≈øpect of the other. Yet if F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> be not ouer forgetfull, he may call to mind that about a moneth after their arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vpon ≈øome occa≈øion of ≈øpeech betweene M. <hi>Ch.</hi> and him, M. <hi>Ch.</hi> told him of ≈øome matters, which F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> pretended hee had not heard before, and ≈øeemed to be a≈øtoni≈øhed at them, wherby at the lea≈øt this may be gathered, that F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> very ra≈øhly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that they had ≈øaid their fill at any time.</p>
            <p>To the ≈øixt, (to omit what meanes and threats the Ie≈øuites, and the Arch-prie≈øt did v≈øe him≈øelfe to be accepted for their ≈øuperiour) they could not expect to carry many Prie≈øts handes in te≈øtimonie of their minds, (who fore≈øawe what would come of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie procured by the Ie≈øuites for their better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øing of the Prie≈øtes) lea≈øt their ≈øtaie ≈øhould be threatned downe vppon his holine≈ø≈øe (by ≈øuch as would let ≈ølip no opportunitie) to be a generall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance thereof.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> In the 13.

            <p>To the fir≈øt, it is an≈øwered, fir≈øt that a litle part of Catholiques may be called Catholiques; ≈øecondly, that all Catholiques are intollerably afflicted at home, and cannot be heard abroad, while they make ≈øute as they are bound to doo for ≈øuch things, as are mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øarie for Chri≈øtians liuing in per≈øecution, and are wanting, in England and cannot be obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as the Sacrament of confirmation, of which F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> could not be ignorant, when he writ the≈øe Letters, nor long before hauing viewed, and review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the petitions of the Prie≈øts, which tho≈øe two carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them to <hi>Rome.</hi> Al≈øo the vnion of all Prie≈øts together; which (as it ≈øhould ≈øeeme by that which hath followed Fa. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> cour≈øes) was but ≈ølubbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer for a ≈ømall time by him, and his fellowes, or adherents who quickly after both by writing,

            <p>To his ≈øecond demaund if he ≈øhould be ≈øatisfied, and the Catholiques named, the ≈øatisfaction would be as fooli≈øhly giuen, as the que≈øtion was asked: hee might with much le≈ø≈øe daunger to Catholiques ≈øay, who they were not; for I do ≈øuppo≈øe, that either there are none ≈øo carele≈ø≈øe of their owne good, or their friends, but they de≈øired what is before mentioned ≈øhould haue bene demaunded, and is not graunted, or at the lea≈øt none ≈øo ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe, as they would di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer ≈øo great a carele≈øne≈ø≈øe in them≈øelues of matters of ≈øo great weight.</p>
            <p>To the third, this an≈øwere may bee made, that doubtle≈ø≈øe he tooke a vizard when he writ it: what audience ≈øaith F. <hi>Par≈øons</hi> is there denied them? were they not with infamie ca≈øt into pri≈øon before it was knowne, whether they brought any thing worth the handling, as is ≈øhewed out of the 10.

            <p>To the fourth it may be truly an≈øwered, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Prie≈øts who haue bene put to death the lea≈øt part (if any at all) haue bene for the Ie≈øuites, or Arch-prie≈øt. And if any difference hath bene made in their per≈øecutions, it hath bene in ≈øhewing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary fauour to the Ie≈øuites, and their adherents, as will be prooued by their v≈øage of F. <hi>Heywood,</hi> M. <hi>Martin Array,</hi> and ≈øuch like.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9135:60"/> that the Ie≈øuites, the Arch-prie≈øt, and ≈øuch other Prie≈øts as are knowne to be guided by them were more per≈øecuted, yea and hated by the Councell of England, then the other Prie≈øts, who are not guided by the Ie≈øuites, perchance this rea≈øon might be giuen thereof, that the Councell haue found by the Ie≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites Letters, which they haue often intercepted, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo by ≈øome bookes of theirs, that they came not ≈øo much into England to ≈øet forward Religion, as they would be thought to do, and as the other Prie≈øts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend vnto, but to further a ≈øtate faction, and to deale therein more then becommeth religious men to doo.</p>
            <p>It is a world to ≈øee how he bu≈øieth him≈øelfe in this kinde, if the Prie≈øts embrace his plottes for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne inua≈øion or ciuil wars in our owne Countrie, they are ≈øubiect to mo≈øt grieuous death due to tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; if they do not, the fauour which they may finde at their better enformed aduer≈øaries hands, mu≈øt bee their perpetuall ignominie.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:9135:72"/> that euer they mainteined any ≈øuch in <hi>England,</hi> but if they had, in my ≈øimple iudgement, it was no good rea≈øon why therefore they ≈øhould be debarred <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and although this were the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was ≈øpecified by the afore≈øaid Letters, yet there was an other iudgement al≈øo, that they ≈øhould not be both in one Regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, as it ≈øhould ≈øeeme; for although in the Cardinall <hi>Burghe≈øe</hi> his Letters of the 15. of September, 1600. to M. <hi>C.</hi> it is in≈øinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they might choo≈øe their place of bani≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confinement, (which is a confe≈ø≈øion) that becau≈øe they had controuer≈øies in ≈øome one place, not certainely ≈øet downe where, (if wee looke into the afore≈øaid mentioned Letters of the 21. of Aprill, 1599.) or becau≈øe by their returne into England, ≈øome controuer≈øies might haue growne there (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by Cardinall <hi>Burghe≈øe</hi> his Letters of the 15. of September, 1600.) they mu≈øt be bani≈øhed out of all places in the world but one, where they mu≈øt liue in relegation God knoweth how long (for neither is there any certaine time ≈øet downe for this) yet in the an≈øwere vnto it, written by M. <hi>C.</hi> the 4. of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umber following, I read that he was not ≈øuffered to be in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as he had made his choi≈øe; and if this was not cau≈øe ≈øufficient for hone≈øt men truly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the ending of their cau≈øe to bemoane them ≈øincerely, and from the heart, yet with this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance at the lea≈øt it might be, that no proui≈øion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for them to ≈øu≈øtaine life, they were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed out of all ≈øuch places, where they might haue meanes to liue, vpon a ≈øuppo≈øed cau≈øe neuer proued again≈øt

               <hi>≈øwere to Fa. Par≈øons Letter, of the 9. of October.</hi> 1599.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Letters (<hi>Father</hi>) of the 9. of Octob. came late vnto my hands, being by you ≈øent about (as it were in circuit) open; to be read &amp; cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out by diuers others before they ≈øhould come vnto me. Meete it was ≈øurely, that ≈øo odde a ≈øtorie might not runne the ordinarie cour≈øe of vulgar Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: but again≈øt the propertie of mi≈ø≈øiues, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary al≈øo to common ciuility, be communicated fir≈øt to others, and la≈øt to him, vnto whom they principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong. Yet truly when I heard of others, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and contents of them, I had no great delight to looke vpon them, but let them lie by me more then a moneth, ere I read them once ouer, ≈øo vnwilling haue I alwaies bene, and yet am, to giue my minde to ≈øuch trouble≈øome bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, which is like to drawe me from a de≈øired repo≈øe, into the li≈øts of an vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing di≈øpute: and that with tho≈øe who pretend to be (as in equitie they ≈øhould be) my verie good friends. I had al≈øo long before often heard of many ≈ølaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rumors rai≈øed of me vniu≈øtly, and ≈øeene ≈øome
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9135:73"/> flying Letters ≈øtuffed full of mi≈øcon≈øtruction of my actions: yet I remained ≈øilent, not without the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of diuers hone≈øt and wi≈øe per≈øonages, for that I ≈øpared to write in defence of my owne innocencie, and to purge and cleare my ≈øelfe from iniurious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny. But I knowing my poore credit to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ≈ømall moment: and fearing lea≈øt to treate of ≈øuch a pittifull ≈øubiect, might be ≈øome hinderance vnto the Catholique cau≈øe: did preferre the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good before my priuate intere≈øt; our ble≈ø≈øed Lords honour before mine owne reputation; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto his omnipotent diuine di≈øpo≈øitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, the ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øe and euent of the whole matter. And ≈øo putting vp patiently tho≈øe iniuries, pa≈ø≈øed ouer the time in ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence quietly, vntill that now (<hi>Father</hi>) you haue by addre≈ø≈øing ≈øuch Letters vnto mee, row≈øed mee (as it were) out of my quiet Lodge, and doo pre≈ø≈øe mee, either to acknowledge for true, that which I take in many pointes to ≈øwarue much from the truth, or to declare and ≈øhewe what I knowe concerning tho≈øe matters. Wherefore being verie ≈øure that the honour of God his cau≈øe cannot be ≈øtained by a true defence of my ≈øelfe his poore ≈øeruant from di≈øhonour, and that it needeth not (as the Prophet ≈øaith) our lying, but is rather by truth and equitie vpholden &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. I will ≈øet downe the veritie of that affaire (as before almightie God my iu≈øt Iudge) mo≈øt ≈øincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and withall, ≈øo temperately, as that no vpright and in different Reader ≈øhall haue rea≈øon to be offended with me. Yet to ≈øpeake (after my manner) plainly, I cannot (<hi>Father</hi>) but mi≈øtru≈øt, lea≈øt you will not take it
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:9135:74"/> well, for you haue alreadie ≈øhewed your ≈øelfe to haue bene mooued with my former Letters, which only had friendly reque≈øts and admonitions: how much the more are the≈øe likely to trouble you, which carry in them al≈øo, free, yet friendly reprehen≈øions; which vnto a high and hotte ≈øtomacke are of much harder dige≈øtion? But to mittigate the matter, con≈øider I pray you, how vnwillingly, and as it were enforced by your ≈øelfe, I come at length to ≈øet penne to paper: and what liberties by God and all good men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vnto all ≈øorts of per≈øons, ≈øpeaking in their own defence: and then remembring how you haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in accu≈øing of vs a rethoricall licen≈øe, you cannot in equitie and rea≈øon, but approue and like in vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, a mode≈øt, Chri≈øtian libertie of ≈øpeech. And ≈øo de≈øiring you to prepare your ≈øelfe vnto ≈øome ≈ømall patience, I come now to the an≈øwere of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>In the beginning whereof you write, that no one Letter appeared as then from mee to you, accu≈øing my long ≈øilence, and within ten lines after, you ≈øay, that that weeke you receiued a Letter from me of an old date, to the which you an≈øwere. What Riddle I pray you may this be? No Letter appeared from me to you when you began to write: and yet that week you had receiued a Letter from mee, what? was the Letter you receiued inui≈øible, that it appeared not in his likene≈ø≈øe when you receiued it? Yet it appeareth by your particular replie vnto the parts thereof, that you had throughly ≈øeene and peru≈øed it. To ≈øay that after you began your Letter you were a weeke ere
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9135:74"/> you came vnto the tenth line of it, &amp; that mine came in the meane ≈øea≈øon, were ridiculous. What then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, but that in the fir≈øt period of your Letter, there is either ≈øome egregious equiuocation, or eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vntruth, which fell out (by God his prouidence as I take it) verie fitly, to forewarne your Readers what credit they may giue vnto much of that which followeth. For, if in the verie fir≈øt lines they find ≈øuch apparant vanitie, voluntarily vttered without anie iu≈øt cau≈øe; let them iudge what conclu≈øion and dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is like to be deui≈øed, when it will ≈øerue for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. Corre≈øpondent vnto this ouer≈øight is that bad con≈øtruction which you make of my former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but that it ≈øauoureth a litle more of an vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table minde. In them I gaue you to vnder≈øtand, that they by whom I pa≈ø≈øed (not all ≈øorts of people as you report) mi≈øliked much of your rigorous dealing: and therefore de≈øired you for the loue of our generall cau≈øe to v≈øe more mildne≈ø≈øe. You hereof inferre that I am fallen into temptation, and much changed from that I was. In this your collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> I find two faults, the one, in that you in≈øinuate that then I ≈øpake <hi>placentia,</hi> but that now I writ <hi>acerba:</hi> There indeed I often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained franckly to ≈øpeake what I thought, becau≈øe it was like to do you ≈ømall good, and more then like to do me much harme, yet I manie times to your ≈øelfe, and to tho≈øe who would tel you all, greeuou≈øly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of your ≈øeuere and rigorous kind of carriage towards your countrimen of all ≈øortes, much vn≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (as me thought) your priuate per≈øon, more di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonant from your holy profe≈ø≈øion, and very ill ≈øuting,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:9135:75"/> both with the times we liue in, and the parties you haue to deale withall.</p>
            <p>The other fault more fowle in my opinion, is that of a friendlie admonition you gather a falling out: &amp; becau≈øe I went about to per≈øwade you, to be more milde, kinde, and curteous, towards your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, who otherwi≈øe endure ≈øorrow inough: you iudge me fallen from your friend≈øhip into a daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation, and to haue incurred many (I know not what) greeuous ≈øinnes and cen≈øures, but I am not greatly di≈ømaid at the≈øe your bigge words and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying con≈øequents; when as I finde them to be (as this is) erronious in the light of nature, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euen by the Heathen Philo≈øophers, who like well, approue, and commend as verie dutifull among deare friends, not onlie exhortations which I then v≈øed for the loue I bare you, but al≈øo reprehen≈øions, which I now come after withall, being therevnto by you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pelled. I am ≈øorry to ≈øee you who haue ≈øo long liued among ≈øo many good religious Fathers, ≈øo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that pitch of humilitie, &amp; mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to contemne him≈øelfe and the honors of this world, &amp; to de≈øire to be euil thought &amp; ≈øpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of: that you may not abide to heare tell of any fault of yours, but by &amp; by, you fall out with your friend, for that he in faire tearmes intreateth you, to looke vnto ≈øuch an euil humor, as partly by naturall inclination, partly by long cu≈øtome of harkening vnto flatterers, you may be ≈øubiect vnto. And albeit in another pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage of yours, you would ≈øeeme not to mi≈ølike them, who aduerti≈øe you of that they think ami≈ø≈øe: yet this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9135:75"/> your euil taking of ≈øuch aduerti≈øements when they come, doth euidently proue the contrarie: and this fault is taken to be too common in ≈øome of your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie; and I my ≈øelfe once before, found the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour in one of your principall Agents in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:<note place="margin">The≈øe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I was ≈øo farre off from receiuing a good an≈øwere (due at lea≈øt in courte≈øie for that I de≈øired it) that my Letters were read openly and ≈øhewed vnto others, and ≈øini≈øter con≈øtruction made of them, to procure me euill will and di≈øcredit. What kinde of religion, ciuilitie, or humanitie may be in ≈øuch maner of dealing, I can hardly perceiue, and li≈øt not heere to di≈øcu≈ø≈øe, hoping that when you ≈øhall ≈øee other men ≈øcanne, examine, and confute your Letters, as you were woont to do theirs; you will be hereafter more mannerly &amp; milde interpreters, lea≈øt you otherwi≈øe hap to meete with the ≈øame mea≈øure that you meat to others. Well, let vs goe on.</p>
            <p>You pretend, that you expected to receiue from me louing Letters and much good ≈øeruice. A great pre≈øumption ≈øurely of my no ≈ømall mortification, if you ≈øpeake vnfainedly. For it were no vulgar vertue for manifolde and manife≈øt ≈ølaunders, calumniari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, impri≈øonment, and exile, which I receiued there among you: to returne and render commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, congratulations, all ≈øorts of ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øies; which neuerthele≈ø≈øe, you would haue the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9135:76"/> world weene that you attended at my hands. But to ≈øpeake without glo≈øing, your owne guiltie con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, tolde you euen before our departure as you ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that you were not like to receiue from mee (whom you knowe to be plaine and round:) any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ordinarie curte≈øie; ≈øuch as the loue of God and lawe of charitie bindeth me vnto: the which for tho≈øe good parts it hath plea≈øed God to endowe you with, I will alwaies afforde you in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and more too, when I ≈øhall perceiue that you e≈øteeme more of it, and to goe about not in emptie words, but by ≈øound deedes better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue it.</p>
            <p>But not to wander vp and downe after all the particularities of ≈øuch a long tedious Letter: I will reduce my whole an≈øwere vnto two points. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ≈øhall ≈øhewe what rea≈øons mooued my brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to ≈øend vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and vs to goe thither at their reque≈øt. In the latter ≈øhall be declared how we were v≈øed there; in the one or the other I will an≈øwere to what≈øoeuer in your Letter touching me, and hope by both to giue ful ≈øatisfaction vnto all hone≈øt, equal, and vpright con≈øciences, of that which they haue heard obiected again≈øt me, concerning that negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The mo≈øt holy and ble≈ø≈øed cour≈øe, of the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reduction of our Countrey vnto the auncient Catholique faith in Apo≈øtolique manner, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øomewhat hindered by a di≈øpute about gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Wisbitch:</hi> and afterwards much more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by emulation, growing betweene ≈øome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:9135:76"/> of the Societie, and certaine other Prie≈øts: who tooke them≈øelues much impeached in their credit by them: it did not a litle grieue me (who had imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great part of my be≈øt yeares in that our good Lords harue≈øt: and had nothing on earth in ≈øo ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular recommendation, as to ≈øee that heauenly work pro≈øper) to con≈øider what impediment and let of it was like to follow, if tho≈øe ≈øparkes of di≈ø≈øention were not ≈øpeedily quenched. Wherefore, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the aunciente≈øt ≈øort, and of better marke, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and affection towards our Countrey, I trauelled about a ≈øoueraigne medicine, for the pre≈øent mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (as it ≈øeemed vnto vs) and a notable pre≈øeruatiue again≈øt any other that might en≈øue afterwardes; which was to vnite and knit our ≈øelues together, in ≈øome louing, ≈øweete, and ea≈øie a≈ø≈øociation and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, that ≈øo by mutuall intelligence, coun≈øell and ayd, we might either prudently preuent, or ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily meete with all inconueniences that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ari≈øe among vs: being now many in number, and euery one left vnto his owne gouernment and di≈øcretion. This matter of vnion was communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto all, and euerie man almo≈øt reque≈øted to ioyne in it: a draught of rules were drawne, which were fewe, ea≈øie, rea≈øonable, and much profitable: which were al≈øo ≈øhewed vnto who≈øoeuer would ≈øee them, that if they mi≈øliked any thing therein, it might be amended, and ≈øo made agreeable vnto all hone≈øt de≈øires. What could in rea≈øon be more demaunded? Yet, becau≈øe this proceeded not, as it is thought from the Societie, nor had any dependance vpon
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9135:77"/> them; although at fir≈øt they ≈øeemed to approoue it much, as that which was in it≈øelfe, hone≈øt, iu≈øt, and nece≈ø≈øarie: yet afterward ≈øeeing it likely to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to growe into ≈øuch a body as theirs is, they openly oppo≈øed them≈øelues again≈øt it, and ≈øtirred vp their fellowes to contradict and cro≈ø≈øe it, as much as they could: and in the meane ≈øea≈øon coyned a new forme of gouernment or ≈øubordination (as they call it) neuer heard of in the Church of God ≈øince the the beginning of the world, vntill our dayes; and by Cardinall <hi>Caietanes</hi> authoritie, cau≈øed the ≈øame to be ca≈øt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vs, at vnawares; our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øents or likings neuer demaunded, vntill it was (as they ≈øaid) e≈øtabli≈øhed. This cunning and audacious enterpri≈øe with the prepo≈øtorous vnadui≈øed proceeding in it: mooued farre greater di≈øcontentment among vs then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was the principall cau≈øe of ≈øending vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> (the ≈øoueraigne Court of Eccle≈øia≈øticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouer≈øie) that from whence the fountaine of our griefe did ≈øeeme to ≈øpring, from thence in like maner we might deriue and drawe the ≈øtreames of con≈øola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That we had many waightie, vrgent, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motiues to ≈øue vnto that Court, a wi≈øe, vpright, and well practi≈øed man in Eccle≈øia≈øticall affaires, ≈øhall (I doubt not) willingly graunt mee after he hath well weighed and pondered the≈øe rea≈øons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; which are taken of the order it ≈øelfe, of the obtaining, ≈øending, publi≈øhing, and executing of it.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, touching this ≈øubordination, it being no ≈øuch as our ≈øauiour Chri≈øt Ie≈øus deliuered to his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9135:77"/> Apo≈øtles, or that hath bene ≈øeene practi≈øed in anie part of Chri≈øtendome the≈øe 1600. yeares: no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though ≈øimple witted men, who de≈øire not to ≈øtraie from the holie ≈øteps of our forefathers, were at the fir≈øt not a little amazed at it, and could not be ≈øo verie ea≈øilie induced to approue it. This al≈øo, be≈øides the noueltie of it, being much more odious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable (as it was then propo≈øed) then anie other gouernment that our predece≈ø≈øors had euer liued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

            <p>The third cau≈øe why this ≈øubordination did mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vs, was for that it came not authentically from his holine≈ø≈øe, by Bull, Breue, or any other lawfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument, but was framed by you <hi>Father</hi> (as it is thought) liked by Cardinall <hi>Caietane,</hi> (a great patron of your plots) and by vertue of his Letters authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed and ≈øent in among≈øt vs. If his L. had beene ≈øo prouident as he was aduenterous, hee ≈øhould haue certified vs before, how he came by any ≈øuch ≈øoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne commaundement ouer our Countrey: for that was vtterly vnknowne vnto the mo≈øt of vs. We had heard that he was Protector of our Colledge, and of our Nation in the Citie of <hi>Rome:</hi> but it litle followeth thereof, that he might erect a ≈øpirituall Monarchy in <hi>England.</hi> For there be in <hi>Rome</hi> many other Protectors of Nations, but yet no one be≈øides him, that taketh vpon him any ≈øuch authoritie. But to purge him≈øelfe from this ≈øtaine of v≈øurpation, hee writeth that his holine≈ø≈øe willed him to take order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt vs for peace and vnitie. Let vs do him the honour to beleeue him on his word (although ≈øome report that hee hath little de≈øerued it at our hands:) was there no other meanes to be found for appea≈øing of all parties, then to ca≈øt vpon vs without our priuities and con≈øents, contrary to the Canons of the Church, a platforme of gouernment, neuer before ≈øeene or heard of in the Church of God? Would not a man maruell where his Lord≈øhips
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:9135:80"/> iudgement was, when he approued without any one pre≈øident ≈øuch nouelties? Surely, their wits ≈øeeme to haue bene gone on wooll-gathering, that inuented this, as a way of peace and vnion; it being mo≈øt like, what for the ≈øtraungene≈ø≈øe of it, as al≈øo for the di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly obtaining and ≈øending of it, to engender much more debate among≈øt vs then was before. For, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the generall voyce of the wi≈øe≈øt Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale men: there is no higher way to di≈ø≈øention and garboiles, then to bring in (as it were perforce) a new and ≈øtraunge order of gouernment. But not to omit any thing for his Lord≈øhips excu≈øe, he writeth in the ≈øame his Letters, that his holine≈ø≈øe liked well of the rea≈øons exhibited vnto him for that ≈øubordination: ≈øo in the ≈øame ≈øente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce he ≈øaith, that we engli≈øh prie≈øts pre≈øented many gentle per≈øwa≈øions vnto his holines, for the admitting of it, but in this his Lord≈øhip ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue bin deceiued: why then might he not ≈øo be in the other? But admit that his holines liked of the rea≈øons, &amp; that there was no ≈øurreption: no more followeth, but that his holines would haue the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall prooue how the prie≈øts in England would like of that ≈øubbordination, and according as he ≈øhould heare of their acception, hee would after either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue or di≈øprooue it.

And truly to declare my opinion, who of many haue thought very well of M. <hi>Blackwell,</hi> and euen then wi≈øhed him greater preferment: he ≈øurely, if he had harkened vnto his owne naturall di≈øpo≈øition and accu≈øtomed mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie, and had not bene by ≈øome ha≈øtie hot-≈øpurres pricked forward, would not vpon ≈øo ≈ølender a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as a Cardinalls Letter, haue taken vpon him ≈øo ≈øtraunge a vocation, again≈øt the con≈øents of ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his bretheren: ≈øome his auncients, ≈øome his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualls, many not much his inferiours, in ≈øtanding, learning, good affection, and merit towards our Countrey: a man of his grauitie and pietie, that had no doubt many times pithily declaimed again≈øt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and de≈øires of honours, ≈øhould at lea≈øt (as mee ≈øeemeth) ere he had vndertaken that dignitie, haue graunted ≈øo many graue learned men, leaue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpite, to informe them≈øelues throughly of the whole matter, before they did binde them≈øelues to that ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</p>
            <p>But to proceed forward in my proofes, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication and execution of this ≈øubordination much more yet increa≈øed our di≈ølikes, and mini≈øtred new occa≈øions to appeale from it. The publi≈øhing of it, by the Arch-prie≈øt his owne Letters, ≈øeemed vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Where were your wi≈øedomes? Could not a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9135:81"/> Letter at lea≈øt haue bene deui≈øed from the Cardinall (who was ready to a≈ø≈øigne al that Father <hi>Par≈øons</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented vnto him) to the Prie≈øts, aduerti≈øing them of this his good plea≈øure, or ≈øome other mannerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention haue bene framed; but that the good man him≈øelfe mu≈øt needs be made his owne Trumpeter and Crier: and be forced to offer that violence to his mode≈øtie, as to blow abroad &amp; divulgate his late atchieued promotion, and to begge of his fellowes, or commaund them (take of the two whether you thinke more ciuil) to like well of his preferment, and therevnto in all ha≈øte, to ≈øet to their hands: they mu≈øt not in anie ca≈øe, ≈øtaie to examine his authoritie, what it was, whence or how it came, but foorthwith put their neckes in the collar, be ≈øubiect and obay him. This vncomely &amp; vntimely ha≈øte to bind our ≈øelues, I know not vnto what ≈øubiection, ≈øeemed verie raw, and of hard dige≈øtion: and nothing ≈øutable with the grauitie and waight of the matter, which required much more mature deliberation.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, when by word of mouth he broached the ≈øame his authoritie vnto certaine Prie≈øts, he to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the matter withall, added thervnto ≈øomewhat of his owne: and being forthwith taken tardie, hee did pre≈øently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fe≈ø≈øe that he indeed put therto ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what: as hone≈øt Prie≈øts on their oathes will te≈øtifie. This gaue a great pre≈øumption that the matter was contriued by their friends, and that they might adde or dimini≈øh at their plea≈øure. Which is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if we call to mind and marke what in≈øtructions he gaue forth at the fir≈øt as receiued from the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9135:82"/> Among others, were the≈øe, that Prie≈øts ≈øhould not meet ≈øecretly together, that they ≈øhould not ≈øend any priuie me≈ø≈øages ouer the ≈øeas; that they ≈øhould take in good part what≈øoeuer was either written or ≈øpoken again≈øt them, and ≈øuch like which are not in the rowle of his in≈øtructions ≈øent him from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, as euerie bodie may ≈øee; and I can by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a true copie of them, when need ≈øhall be, eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demon≈øtrate: and be≈øides are ≈øo voide of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, ≈øo odious and intollerable in our Country, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at this time, when Prie≈øts cannot meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or do any thing, but in ≈øecret: that a babe might plainly feele them, neuer to haue proceeded from his holine≈ø≈øe, or from anie noble, free or compa≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heart, but to ≈øauour of (I know not what) ba≈øe minde too too much addicted to terror, crueltie, and ≈øeruitude.

Now that controuer≈øies be wel decided, and all hone≈øt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties agreed, it was meete (perdie) to choo≈øe vpright and indifferent Iudges and Arbiters, who ≈øhould without fauour, feare, loue, or hatred, waigh euerie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9135:82"/> mans cau≈øe vprightly, in the ballance of equitie, and without re≈øpect of per≈øons, giue ≈øentence according to iu≈øtice. This is a principall in iudgement ≈øo cleare, by the light of nature, that it is graunted of verie <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans:</hi> yet in our cau≈øe very badly ob≈øerued: for both the Arch-prie≈øt and his coun≈øellours, (vnto whom the determination of our cau≈øes are to be referred) were all cho≈øen by the one partie, with a ≈øpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øo, that no one be admitted vnto that number, who did not greatly fauour the ≈øame partie: howe contrary ≈øoeuer they were vnto the other partie, it imported not: yea perhaps the more earne≈øtly bent again≈øt them, the rather elected.

            <p>Two proper points of pollicy I ob≈øerue in this election, the one in choo≈øing the Officers ≈øo plyant to their plea≈øures, that they may be the more readie to runne byaz when it will ≈øerue their turnes. And yet becau≈øe men are mutable, to hold them in awe, their authorities might be taken from them, what time ≈øoeuer the Cardinall thought good, as in the points it is to be ≈øeene: but let this goe, becau≈øe I tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

            <p>Well to drawe towards the end of my former part, this ≈øubordination being both ≈øtraunge in the Church of God, hatefull of it≈øelf, and not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed in our countrey in the≈øe times, it being al≈øo procured (as it ≈øeemeth) by fal≈øe ≈øugge≈øtion, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by him, that was not knowne to haue any ≈øuch authoritie, and finally by partiall election of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, tending vnto the oppre≈ø≈øion of many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table per≈øonages, who had excellently well de≈øerued of our countrey by their long and fruitfull trauells: yet remaineth euident and mo≈øt manife≈øt, that wee had ≈øundry, iu≈øt, lawfull and great cau≈øes in humble ≈øort to ≈øue vnto our ≈øuperiours for a mitigation or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of it, and for e≈øtabli≈øhing of ≈øome better and more fit for our countrey. Whereof appeareth fir≈øt, how vaine that vaunt of yours is, where you ≈øay, that we came and brought nothing with vs, and that you were a≈øhamed to ≈øee that wee had taken ≈øo long a iourney and had ≈øo litle to ≈øay, when be≈øides the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes before mentioned, we had many other points al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo of importance in our me≈ø≈øage.

And albeit you cleare me of that crime mo≈øt willingly (as you write) yet as men that ≈øpeake hollowly, and not from the heart, you giue forth ≈øome ≈øu≈øpitions out of other mens ≈øpeeches, and lay downe in their names, your rea≈øons for confirmation of them. The fir≈øt is, that in the papers we brought with vs, there were
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:9135:84"/> voyces for our promotion: I an≈øwere, that with tho≈øe papers I was not much acquainted, as one that neither gathered them, nor carried them; and full well I knowe and prote≈øt, that by accord among our ≈øelues, it was determined before I re≈øolued to take that iourney, that they which were ≈øent ≈øhould not accept of any preferment willingly, although it were offered them, lea≈øt they ≈øhould giue their euill wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers occa≈øion to carpe at them, rather to ≈øeeke their owne particular, then their generall good.

Their la≈øt rea≈øon was, for that in an other Letter of I know not who≈øe (the phra≈øe is) of your L L: for your Lord≈øhips: but this Letter would neuer be ≈øhewed (although it were mo≈øt in≈øtantly de≈øired) becau≈øe they ≈øaid it to be from a very friend of ours, a general an≈øwer vnto the≈øe Letters is; that it is ea≈øie, for tho≈øe that li≈øt to deui≈øe what Letters wil be≈øt ≈øerue for their turnes, and then make great matter out of them. But how≈øoeuer it were, yea admit that all were true, as they ≈øay: yet nothing el≈øe can be prooued out of them, then that many wi≈øhed and de≈øired our prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whereof who≈øoeuer would gather, that wee

This my negligence grew in part, of the ouerweening, I had of their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie, charitie and religion, with or again≈øt whom I had to deale: whom I found (much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trarie vnto my expectation) ≈øharply bent vnto warre and ho≈øtilitie, and vtterly re≈øolute to take adui≈øe of no man; but <hi>omnibus vijs &amp; modis,</hi> as they ≈øay, determined what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer came of it, to do their owne willes. God graunt them therefore good wills and wayes; and ≈øo to knit vp this part, all that I haue ≈øaid concerning the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie≈øt &amp; the ≈øubordination, is not to di≈øcourage any of my brethren from it, beeing now confirmed by his holine≈ø≈øe; and for that it is better to raunge our ≈øelues vnder what≈øoeuer order, then to loo≈øe our times about contentions: but (as I ≈øhewed before) it is to purge and cleare vs from ≈øundrie fal≈øe accu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being therevnto as it were by others enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and to ≈øhewe what rea≈øon wee had to doo that which we did.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the latter part, wherein I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to declare how we were v≈øed there: the which I

If in the relation of it, I differ ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from you, you mu≈øt beare with me, for that you di≈ø≈øent much (by your leaue be it ≈øpoken) from the veritie of that matter, it may be, you remember not ≈øo well, what then was done, as we which felt it; <hi>Pium e≈øt hoc credere,</hi> it is good ≈øo to thinke, although it be more like, that you being a≈øhamed to heare what was reported of it, thought it good policie to colour and di≈øgui≈øe the matter as much as you could, and much more then you ≈øhould, to ≈øaue your credit, with tho≈øe at lea≈øt, which take all your words for Oracles; and by the fir≈øt ≈øetting of it foorth vnder your name, to fore≈øtall (as it were) and drawe vnto you other ≈øimple ≈øoules that are too credulous. Wherefore I am to reque≈øt all indifferent readers, who hath ≈øeene yours, not to ≈øuffer them≈øelues to be carried away with a ≈ømoothe tale cunningly tolde them, but they will keepe one eare for vs; and then (laying all affection and partialitie a≈øide) hauing heard both parties, iudge vprightly as before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, the ≈øoueraigne and mo≈øt iu≈øt Iudge. To come then to the matter, I will fir≈øt ≈øet downe how all things pa≈ø≈øed plainely, and afterwards exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine mo≈øt briefly the iu≈øtice of it, and ≈øome points of your narration.</p>
            <p>We comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> about the time you write (for where you tell truth I will agree with you) not

            <p>I denie now as I did vnto you then, that I ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted my ≈øelfe from his obedience, either therefore ≈øet downe, wherein by word or deed, I with drew my ≈øelfe from his obedience, or el≈øe let the world take you for an egregious calumniatur. For I was with the Arch-prie≈øt before I went, and tolde him of my iourney, and gaue him the cau≈øe of it in writing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my hand, taking al≈øo a copie of it vnder his hand; and he neuer commaunded me not to goe, neither in any other point did I tran≈øgre≈ø≈øe any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.

Our ≈øtatute

Is it po≈ø≈øible his holine≈ø≈øe and the gratious Cardinalls you haue ≈øo notably abu≈øed, ≈øhould neuer be brought to knowe the innocencie of vs whom you haue thus wronged and per≈øecuted in our bretheren, and neuer can cea≈øe to afflict? Will they neuer, thinke you, finde out your deceit, and by iu≈øt di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of our cau≈øe, relieue our mi≈øeries, and repay you your de≈øerts? The clamours of innocent men, will in time no doubt, a≈øcend vp to heauen, and wee cannot but hope that our Lord Ie≈øu (who≈øe worke we haue in hand, and who≈øe glorie wee ≈øeeke with innumerable vexations for his ≈øake) will once ≈øtirre vp and direct his Vicar, to iudge and di≈øcerne our cau≈øe, and to deliuer vs from your mo≈øt violent and wrongfull oppre≈ø≈øions.

For defame vs before wee come; impri≈øon vs at our arriuall; keepe vs clo≈øe from being ≈øeene or heard; yet ≈øhall you not goe ≈øo away with your iniquitie; we are re≈øolued verily, that with our good names, you ≈øhal bereue vs al≈øo of our liues, before we ≈øit downe with this vnde≈øerued calumnie. Either will wee bee prooued no Schi≈ømatickes, or
